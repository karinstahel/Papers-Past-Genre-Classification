390,1854-07-08,OW,Otago Witness,3,ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE.,"To the Editor of the Otago Witness. Sir, — My attent'on has been directed to an arti cle on the New Zealand Company's Land Sale in your last paper, in which is inserted certain spiteful remarks, written with the evident object of doing me an injury. Your remarks are so obviously im prudent, and the character of your paper so gene rally appreciated, that I could afford to pass it with out notice, were it not for the opinion of some that an untruth ought not to go uncontradicted. It is for your readers to judge of your policy in obtruding upon them the private matters of indhiduals, even though they be those of your friend versus your humble servant. But has your friend been injured by the sale of the proj erty alluded to ? It may be ascertained upon inquiry that Mr. Adam has made arrange ments for residing in the country, and with this ob ject has endeavoured to sell his house to several in dividuals, proving that he did not for his own use require the land upon which it is erected ; and as under the liberal arrangements of the Commissioner of Crown Lands he was allowed a much higher va luation than he had previously asked, it was gene rally and justly inferred that the transfer of the pro perty into other hands would not in the slightest degree inconvenience Mr. Adam. And that lam under any obligation to your fiiend — as you allege — is most provokingly false, as may be shewn from the fact that he called upon me twice for the purpose of obtaining my consent to allow him to put in my pro perty along with his own for valuation, on purpose that"" the whole might be put up to auction under his name, but which I refused to allow. Mr. Adam, therefore, could not prevent the section being divid ed. And again that the reply which you say he made to Mr. Man tell was not sincere, and that the case of sympathy for him, which you endeavour to hang upon it, is groundless, may at once be^ proved by a reference to documents now in my possession, and which you may at any time see, shewing that Mr. Adam has lately used his best endeavour to eject me from the property, and only gai c up the process when he discovered that he had no chance of success. And, Mr. Editor, equally untrue and less excusable is your remark that there was a gene ral expression of disapprobation at the sale. I refer to any other person who was there present if there was any the slightest visible signs of such. And it is only another example of how far and for how low and mean an object you will prostitute your pen when it suits your purpose. — I am, &c, John Sidey. P.S. — I would here once for all caution your 'friend of the base and untruthful report which he is endeavouring to circulate.— J. S. ■ [We pass over Mr. Sidey s remarks regarding our selves as -unworthy of notice. The documents to which'he refers, we think, would be as uncreditable to him as the transaction which gave rise, to our re marks, _ The facts referred to are these: Mr. Adam complained to Mr. Sidey of the nuisance connected with the dressing of his sheep-skins, and had ulti mately to employ Mr. Harris to request Mr. Sidey to remove , the cause , of the nuisance, or otherwise to purchase his- (Mr. Adam's) interest in the section.

110,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,37,The Edendale Dairy School.,"TO THB BDITOB. Sin, — Having been a student at the Edendale Dairy School, I should like to make a few rtmaika on the letter of ""Factory Man"" in the last issue of the Witness. He says he bas received a sample of the Edendale Dairy School butter, and after speaking highly of its flavour, colour, texture, &c., he says that ""it is most unmistakably streaked or marbled right through the sample."" He farther asserts that (he cause cannot be ""for want of sufficient working — rather tho other way."" Having Said to much, I will attempt to explain the oauie of the streakiness. During the three weeks I was at the dairy school there was only one day's churning, to far as I am aware, that was streaky, and ""Factory Man"" p'o bably received a sample from that churning. The lot I referred to was overcburned, and more than that, it received too much working before the salt was incorporated with it. We Lad to judge the butter every d*y, and I asked Sir Buisk the cause of the streakiness, his reply being that it was due to the salt not having been properly worked in ib. Having had con siderable experienoe in butter-makiDg, I quite agree with our teacher's explanation, and I may Add that long before I went to the dairy school I attributed the cause of straakißess to the salt not having been properly mixed with the butter. It is alwajs possible to guard against streaky butter, but accidents will happen, even where the conditions are most favourable. Perhaps yon will allow me to add that I bave a high •pinion of the knowledge of dairy matters pos sessed by all the teachers at the school, and that the information imparted must be of great advantage to the whole of the students. — I am, fee..

70,1896-11-09,OAM,Oamaru Mail,28,MAJOR STEWARD'S MEETING.,"TO THE EDITOK. Sir,—ln your issue of the 4th inst. 1 read the report of Major Steward's address, and consider it political claptrap and gross misrepresentation, particularly that portion of the report of the questions put and nbt answered. At the close of his address he told the meeting that the Land for Settlement Scheme was a pro nounced success ; yet, in the face of this statement, why was a sum of money placed upon the Estimates to enable the Minister of Lands to farm a portion of the Pomahaka? The Major did not answer these questions. Then, again, there were about 394 divisions taken in the House during the late session. How many did the Major vote for 1 About 25. Does the gallant Major suppose we sent him to Wellington to sit upon a rail during the session? Certainly not. Then, again, the Major said he supported the banking legislation to prevent a dire calamity be falling the colony. Yet he said in the House that he regretted recording his vote in supporting this measure. How does he reconcile this statement ? Then, again, when he voted against the Usury Prevention Bill introduced by Mr Seddon, he said he was not aware that he had done so. Now, in the face of all this misrepre sentation, the gailanc Major,stands con demned. I, sir, ask the electors, to"" pori der over these facts, as our worthy Major in the field is a candidate determined to go to to the poll in the Government in terest, on a very advanced platform. They, like myself, will judge the candi dates upon their merits, and will, on the day of the poll, record their vote for the most fit and proper candidate that is worthy of the representation of the Wai taki electorate.—lam, etc: Scrutator.",1,2.027977795,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/oamaru-mail/1896/11/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(To the Editor of the Star.) g lE . —When the poet laureate wrotei the stanza above quoted, he surely must have had in his mind's eye, a prophetic forecast oi the dawn of a brother bard, whose lyrical ef fusions would be destined to shed an unfad ing lustre on his illustrious name, and illumine'the age and country in which he wrote. Need I say I allude to the sweet lyrist who nightly thrills all hearts with his touching melodies, drawn from that pure well of inspiration, the Police Court? So great is my admiration of this charm ing poet, whose graceful imagery and playful fancy remind one of Owen Meredith. and Catnach, of the Dials, that I would fain in my enthusiasm, echo the aspiration of the Swan of Avon, when he puts in the mouth of ODe of his creations the following aspiration : Oh, that the fountain of thy mind were a well that I might water an ass at it! . The animal would needs grow' sleek and plump by sipping at such a Helicon, and might in time bray forth in tuneful numbers stanzas that would be quoted side by side with the following flowing versicles :— Oh. that I might live and die With the Maid ot Ponson-by. 'Twere sweet to breath my la+est sigh For thee, sweet Maid of Ponson-by. On earth no other charms c*n vie.

In conclusion, why, oh why, waß the legend of Joseph and Mary not done into poetry a la Wemmick? Was the spring of inspiration temporarily choked up ? Was the Toper Ehymster not up to the mark ? To miss Buch a magnificent theme—such scope for ingenious rhymes— for instance :— Shindies they had had by dozens, Scarcely were they cater cousins. Though guiltless of alleged offences, The plaintiff paid the law exoenses ; The Bench observed it would leel pain, • > If e'er they came to Court again.

Ward, in which I am rather roughly ""handled. My first thought was, can this S'gna tore be that of the great J. G. Ward, who has 'lately made -a triumphal march through two forming alliances and arranging treaties right and left f cam Japan to Vancouver Island, astonishing the financial magnates of the ;Old World, and even "" flattening out"" the •governor of the /Bank of England en route ? Can .it he posssible that 1 have the honour of being .vilified by such a great m»n? I can scarcely .think so. Mr Editor, are you certain that you .are. not being made the victim of a cruel hoax ? ""I would expect that one who has rubbed -noßes .with royalty in the person of the ""first , gentleman in Europe,"" not to mention Ripon And other smaller fry (my patriotism prevents me .-from even hinting at a celebrated inteiview with ihe London Chamber of Commerce), could not be the author of 11m letter referred to. Still, nearly .all great men have their weaknesses. 1 here was, for instance, Alexander the (ireit. We all know his weakness— Scotch whisky. The great Napo leon w*B vain of his personal appearance ; and why should not the great J. 6. W. have his weakness ? .1 have a'faint recollection of how he floundered in the celebrated binder twine controversy, especi ally in his opening letters, and if he is really the .author of the letter in which I have the honour of being. vilified,! am inclined to think that intern ...perate effusions to the press are his weak mess. If so, I would strongly xecomniend ''him in future, when he feels it coming on, to retire quietly to the back yard and dance on his hat 'a while, and then write. -Thisplan, if adopted, would have the advantage of concealing to some extent the .failings of the .great man from the vulgar gaze, and his tffusions in the future woulit no doubt show some trace of , -the suavity of manner for which he was so dis tinguished :ere he departed from these shores on his ambassadorial tour. _Is it not strange thst it never seems to have occurred to the great man that a satisfactory ex planation might have been given if he had applied to the proper party, in the u^ual way ; in stead of which he seizes on .a cap, which he says somebody else told him was his, not only puts it on his head, but actually pulls it hard down over -his eyes, and then demands that I should prove that the cap belongs to him.

David Pinkerton, Esq., M.H.R , Wellington. Sir,—We venture to approach you as senior member for Dunediu, with a view of asking your assistance in an effort to prevent the sudden alterations in the tariff, which were announced On the 31st ultimo, from, causing us a certain loss which, we respectfully beg to submit, is neither necessary nor desirable. What we wish is named in the first part of a resolution which was passed by th» Chamber of Osmmerce in Ohristchurch on the Ist intt., which reads as follows:—""In caves where duties are reduced or abolished we would earnestly recom mend the justice of postponing bringing into operation of the proposals until January 1 next. A similar course has been followed previously both in this and other colonies."" If we bad the time hero asked for, we would cave little difficulty in disposing of our stocks of the lines in question between this and the end of the year, and it would be a very simple matter to place in^bond until then any btocks coming for ward which might not be required for consump tion until the beginning of 1896. We could write many more reasons showing why what we claim is only fair and equitable, but, no doubt, in your position you have made a study of the subject, and will be tetter able than we to advocate our cause with the Colonial Treasurer. Praying that you will place^our views before the Government at the earliest pos.ible moment, and accord us a reply at your convenience, —Wo have, Ac.

132,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,59,THE BALFOUR TRAGEDY.,"THE S.M.'S REMARKS IN COMMITTING KSOWN. When committing John Keown for trial at Gore on the 31st on a charge of hnving murdered Hugh Stewart on the 20th July near Balfour, Mr Hawkins, S.M., said:— ""l have not to decide the fate of the accused ; that is work reserved to higher tribunal. That an acfe of frightful violence has been committed is unquestionable. The culpability of the accused is not decided here, but as magistrate of this district 1 have to establish the respect for Uw and the maintenance of the principles of public order. There i* a tendency in a certain section of the people — not perhaps entirely unjustified by the present state of the criminal law— to treat some acts of violence against the person as of less gravity than offences against property. That is a very dangerous opinion. It is of greatest importance that persons should be taught the paramount necessity of restrain ing their savage instinct?, of dominating their passions, and of refraining from the use of any sbimuknb which they know diminishes their power of self-control. A civil wrong, real or fancied, offers no excuse whatever for personal violence. In this democratic community the courts of justice are always open, and redress always obtainable. I have been struck with the attitude of a certain number of persons at Riversdale and here. Ido not complain that anybody should entertain sorrow fora criminal — provided that they do not allow that sorrow to interfere with justice, — but it is horrible to think that any man or woman in this colony should have sympathy with crime. I hope that those who have confused the two in their minds will consider what I soy, for no more dangerous evil can rear its head in any community than a sympathy — otiminal OC cowardly, open or dUguhed — with crime. I was compelled to protest this afternoon againsd levity in the audience in- this court, and then referred to acts of cowardice. I want to make ib plain that I - did nob re F er to Middlemias. If fear lent hint wiogs, I bhink he was only too well justified in his fear. He was unarmed and wholly defenoele.Es, and I am glad that he escaped. Tho cowardice I referred td ia that of those wh6 stood by, unquestionably anticipating violence, and, instead of preventing it, who passively acquiesced if they did not actually wsiab. I»m convinced that Hornsey and Windus have nott told bhis court all that they know. It is to ba hoped that in a higher courb they will not per* severe in their course of concealment They have a duty to justice higher than any othec duty whatever.""",1,1.942741211,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
292,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,219,OVER THE TEACUPS.,"Dear Rbadbks, — As I write the words, and think of what, odds and ends I have fathered for our afternoon's chat, I confess wish I bad something brighter, more amusing — some brilliant flash of oolour for our patchwork. As the hail and sleet drives against the window, and again, surprised by a suspicious stillness, I look up and see the white snowflakes hurrying by in a silent whirling army, my thoughts go, swifter than the snowflake*, to all my country readers. I see the leaden skies and snow-covered plains which look so white and deathlike ; I ccc the ghostly summits of the mountains breaking through the driving mists — all the world bo cruelly cold, all the air made sad and mourn ful by the silence and tho thought that away there in the solitudes the poor silly sheep are penned condemned to slow starvation. I know so well that however cotty and oorn fortable you may be in your pretty dining room or cheery farm kitchen, some thought of loss, of hard times, of Buffering animal life, and, most of all, sympathy for huabandt and sons whose battle with fortune (waged for your sakei) is made so much the hardor by suoh a winter comes to sadden wlvei »nd daughters alike. Thinking thus, I feel ashamed to remember that we town people, sitting over the flro with the morning papor and tho ovoninft paper, the month's maguxlnes and the lost new novel, grumble desperately when tho trams cannot run because of the enow t And snow reminds me to ask you if yon have heard the late«fc of the advanced woman. Bhe is ""to advance still farther, even to the North polo. A lady in to form one of the Austrian North Pole expedition, undertaken by the famoun artist and Arctic explorer, Juleß Payer. The particular lady is also an artist. She asked to be allowed to join the party, and her request baa been granted. Woman wants the whole carth — yea, from the North Pole down to the electoral poll 1 "" By the way, in Blackwood's Magazine for May there is a charming account of Bur mese women. Reading it brings one to the conclusion that they may well be happy, con tent, and noble. "" Nowhere under the sun has any nation accorded to the women snob, absolute freedom, Bush entire command of their lives and property as have the Burmese. They stand in every way on an absolute equality with men as far as law, as religion, and as customs are concerned."" Again we read : "" Married or unmarried, from the age of 16 or 17, every woman has some occupation beside her own home duties."" How charming it sounds, and how difficult to realise unless we set our selves to contrast the elaboration of our lives with the simplicity of theirs ! If the Bur mese women bad all our cumbrous cares of cookery, needlework, changing fashions, and quickly worn-out garments ; if she was a slave to her oarpets. curtains, and furniture, to say nothing of her social duties, I doubt not that her home duties, like ours, dears, would suffice for her. I often think what unending and unnecessary cares our civilisation burdens us with. It makes one long sometimes for a more natural, less highly-improved existence. As you know, I sometimes find things to interest us in the "" Committee of the Whole House "" column of the Leisure Hour. It is by no means an unusual thing for my girl friends in the country to lament their "" shy ness."" Now these girls would have been decidedly interested in one of the questions laid before "" the whole house "" in June. "" Can shyness be overcome ? And what method Bhould be adopted to this end?"" The two chief answers were as follows : — No. 1 took the form of another question, and ran thus : "" Is not shyness one of the many forms assumed by selfishness 1 If people would forget themselves and think of the feelings and claims of others more than of their own they would cease to {be miserably self-conscious — or, In other words, they would cease to be Bhy."" Very gooS advice, and serious withal, but I am not sure that I do not agree more heartily with answer No. 2: — "" I once heard a story of a girl who was ex tremely bashful. ... At last she made up her mind to pray about it, and this was her J prayer: 'Oh Lord, when I have to go amongst other people, give me a good con ceit of -myself.' "" It seems to me that we women of New Zea- ' land are justified in having a reasonably "" good conceit"" of ourselves just now. To "" see ourselves as others see us ' is usually commended as a healthful corrective to vanity, but to see ourselves as others see us may* sometimes apparently be lookiog through rose-coloured spectacles. At the special general meeting held at Whitehall on April 30, when Mr Ward delivered his famous address on New Zealand, an interesting and somewhat informal discussion followed. Several speakers, including the Bishop of Salisbury, commented on our domestic life, servants, wage 3, and other homely topics. The Bishop paid New Zealanders a graceful compliment in these words : ""Itis a great pleasure to travel there and talk with your neighbour in the train, or in their homes. Wherever you go you find the people more intelligent, I think, on the average than in England."" Then Miss May Yates, who "" spent a few most enjoyable months touring ing New Zealand,"" made a few observations, in the course of which she said : "" I have the greatest admiration for the wonderful capa cities of the women, their all-round ability for doing all kinds of domestic work, and yet they are graced with all modern accomplish ments."" It seems to me that we have only to "" live up to "" the standard of such good opinions to be all that our country can desire of us. Filial affection and devotion appeals to all women, and I frankly confess that in reading the interesting sketch of the famous Chinese Viceroy, Li Hurg Chang, I was deeply struck by the detailed account of the great states man's mourning for hiß mother. The character sketch referred to was 'given in the June Review of Reviews, and the writer had been deeply impressed with the depth and sincerity of the Chinese Viceroy's grief, which was evidently no mere formality, but a real potting on of sack cloth and ashes — a starving and morti fying of the flesh. Listen to this gentenoe; "" And yet this was a nobleman, careful as to comeliness in person and the niceties of raiment, rather disposed to ostentation than otherwise. There was every evidence that this the first man in the empire had been as if he vr ere its m ane- t subject— down in the very dost in privation and penance, doing reverence to his mother's memory as appointed by faith."" Do you not find this • picture touohing? I confess I do, though of all coloured races I have least sympathy with the Obinese. In a recent number of the New Zealand Graphic we are honoured with a picture of 11 Mrs Ward, Wife of the Colonial Treasurer; in her Presentation Gown.""

32,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,9,Original Correspondence.,"{To the Editor of the Bruce Herald. ) Sir, — Sometime ago a facetious correspon dence took place in your columns with refer ence to the "" Big drum nuisance,"" and I quite approved of the band standing upon their rights at that time. But it occurs to me that the time has now arrived whenthe ""nuisance"" might be abated. In the fine long Saturday evenings what is to prevent the band playing up and down the streets, instead of coupiug themselves up in the Hall ? They have now, attained to a state of efficiency at whi&i they heed not be ashamed to appear in the streets. : The music would be gratifying to a number of .tine inhabitants,, and would also relievb those in the immediate neighborhood of the hall, of the incessant noise which, notwithstanding ""North's"" advocacy, must be inconvenient to men when serving customers. The band may also by and by require some little pecu , niary assistance in some matter or other, and I would just hint that were they to come my way of an evening, I might be the more ready to put my hand in my pocket when; called . upon to do so. But confining their music to .- a hall with closed doors, what interest can tha^ .public take in the band? None whatever*; . indeed they rather feel offended than other? ; wise because they keep all their mWc to themaelvea I am &0., f South Bw». (To the Editor of theßnice Herald:) Sir, — I was not a little surprised a short time ago in reading a letter in the corre spondence columns of one of the Tokomai riro papers, writteu by quite a young man. condemning the action of the elders of a certain church in Tokomairiro. For my own part I do not like to see youth attempt to startle age with threats, etc., and attempt to come down hard on the heads of men whose judgment should be sounder — at least, whose age and position should be honored by younger men. I do not wish to create any ill feeling now ; I merely mention the affair to show that T have respect to men aud their doings, if they are trying to do good without prejudice or favor. Well, sir, it now be comes my gainful duty to condemn in strong terms tha unanimous decision of- your School Con.-miotee, respecting assistance being granted to the Adam's Flat Day school. 1 condemn them the more because they were v nanimous. Surely in all school committees there might be expected to be one able and willing to deal with any matter brought be fore them on its merits That our affair has not been so dealt with, I will very soon con vince you. In the first place then, the Go vernment must have seen that a school would some time be required on the Flat, they having left a school reserve only a short distance from where our school now stands, Have we done wrong in forestalling the Go vernment, in trying to establish that which we feel to be greatly needed ? If so, let that be the committee's excuse, and leave out close proximity to Glenore or the age of the children, which only confirm the argument in our favor. Jf we were in such close prox imity to Glenore, why should we just have gone to such trouble and expense to erect a church for adults ? It strikes me very for cibly that all our School Committee men must be single men. They cannot have any sympathy with young children from four years of age and upwards in wading their way through long grass, over high rocky hills,, in all kinds of weather, three and a-half miles, and some of them over four, rather than in jterfere with the old established school at | Glenore. Thank you, gentlemen, for your ■ unanimous resolution ! very considerate, very ! We do not wish to interfere with any ; old establishment. Ours is a new one, and must be supported and receive Government assistance. If your committee refuse to re cognise us, we must appeal to the district, and try what a petition will do. Their unanimous resolution referred to says, in effect, to us. ""you have built a church, opened a school, gc on now and support it."" ' — I am, &c, LIVEB. j (To the Editor of the Brace Herald ) Sir, — The writer of an article on "" Immi gration"" in the ' Daily Times ' of a recent date, and reproduced in the ' Witness ' of Ist December, laments the scarcity of labor in this Province, and the consequent high rate of wages its employers hare to pay. He goes on to observe that the progress of the ! colony is retarded by all important industries being crippled from this cause, and that we are thus necessitated to import-articles which ought to be produced on the spot. The expression ""ought to be produced,"" &c., seems to me a little vague. He continues, ""The reason for this is still the same ; Great Britain, America, and even the colonies ad jacent to us, produce and supply these articles at prices which defy the competition of the producer here, simply on account of the high rate of wages which he has to pay. All these facts are easily demonstrable."" The last is rather a sweeping assertion and has a tinge of that sort of language about it that men use who are anxious that what they are saying should obtain credence, although they are not at all certain that it is true. May I ask yon to compare the remarks of this writer with the following extract from one of a series of letters, published in the •London Spectator,' by Mr Robert Coningsby, on the Working Classes in the United States : — ""From a long list showing the entire business transacted during three months at the Calif ornian Labor Exchange. I pick out the following few facts, showing wastes actually obtained by people who had just arrived in San Francisco in the enrly part of the summer of 1868. 1844 general laborers were ""found in situations in town and country at rates varying from two dollars to jtwo dollars and a-half per day without board, or from thirty to forty dollars per month with board and lodging ; the dollar in California meaning gold. Thus we find rough and unskilled laborers getting up wards of fifty shillings per week, besides their board and lodging, and savings' banks at hand where ten per cent interest can be ob tained on all they can lay by. * * * * ■ As;ain, I find that 37 engineers were pro vided with work at rates varying from 50 to 80 dollars per month with board ; 1164 farm hands at rates a little higher than the general unskilled laborers, some of them getting as much as 60 dollars with board. 409 carpenters found work at wages varying from 8 to 5 dollars per day; and so on through sheet after sheet of official figures, not issued from a clap-trap advertising agency office, but vouched for by no less a personage than the Governor of the State."" If this account is true, and there seems no reason to doubt its being reliable, how does it bear out the statement in the ' Times' that in America wages are much lower than they are Bere, and will the writer undertake to ex plain how it is that California exports cereals and flour to these colonies, when the wages are not nearly so high- as they are on the western sea-board of the States. It might not perhaps be very difficult to find men who could give a reason for it, but I don't know that it follows that the political economist of the ' Times ' would do so. lam. &c, •3? T.S.R.

87,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,14,Mr Begg and the Frozen Meat Trade.,"TO THB EDITOH. Sib,—Mr Begg's remarks at the annual meet ing of the Danedin Chamber of Commerce are interesting. Ho says : "" That in view of the low prices lately realised, there have been several schemes propounded for putting the trade upon a better footiDg,"" and ""in support of these schemes many unfounded statements have been made."" I know of two schemes only that have been made public, Mr Nathan's and my own, and I challenge Mr Begg to point to one single "" anfounded statement"" in my proposals. Since I wrote my paper I have obtained the offioi&l report of the chief inspector of stock for New So -th Wales (Mr Bruce), who was sent by the Government of that colony to Great Britain and the Continent to make a special report upon the frozen meat trade, and, there fore, he is likely to have formed a more correct opinion than any casual visitor like Mr Begg would do. And I am glad to find that Mr Bruce corroborates in every particular all I hat I said upon the subject. The report contains a fund of information, and upholders of the present system of disposing of our mutton should read it. Mr Begg approves of one of the chief points in my proposal —viz., concentration at Home. ' Ho says : "" I think that were it possible to get all the companies in the colony to agree to have the eale of their meat put under the control of one person or firm in England, who would do no other business, and who would be xeiponsible to them for the management, we should probably have better prices all round."" So far, therefore, he agrees that it is advisable that it should be under ono organisation at Home. That is precisely what I advocate; but he condemns the pro posal to put it under one management in the colony. He gives no reason for making this distinction, but he says that ""he looks with considerable apprehension on the attempts • being made by » large firm [presumably NelsoH Uros.] already in the trade to secure-a practical monopoly of the frozen meat business, and that if these attempts are successful a fatal blow will be struck, not only at the interests of sheep growers and graziers, but at the general pros perity of the colony."" This is refreshing coming from Mr Begg. I have little doubt that tie is perfectly correct in his opinion, but in pro posing that "" all the companies should agreb to put their meat under one control at Home "" he appears to have forgotten that Nelson Bros, are very largely interested in these companies or freezing works. Several of them belong to them. Is it likely, therefore, tbat they would Agree to Mr Begg's proposition, as they now v fexpect to make such a profit from them through the new company they are establishing P I think before we can secure control at Home we must secure it in the colony. It is remarkable that although ""we are intelligent enough to grow the finest mutton in the world, we are not intelligent enough to distribute it to advantage."" The more one reads of what is going on iv o'hsr countries the more one must be convinced that combination in any article of universal con« sumption is absolutely necessary, or the modern system of competition will kill any enterprise. Mr Begg implied in His speech that the whole of the capital was to be guaranteed by Government under one of the schemes. This I think is an error. Mr Nathan proposed tbat one-half should be to guaranteed and secured by a special sheep tax levied annually. I suggested one-fourth enly, and a sheep tax of id per head, to be levied only in the event of the associatioa being unable to pay interest upon the guaranteed debentures. Four per cent, on half a million sterling would be covered by a farthing rate. I can under stand chambers of commerce, shipping com ! panics, &c. objecting to this proposal. Their reasons are obvious. There are numerous pre cedents for such a guarantee, and it is a false sentiment to raise the petty objections hitherto taken to such a course. No sound one has yet been given. The guarantee of debentures is not of so much importance as the recognition by the Government of the proposed association would be>»in breaking through the present powerful rings that influence and govern the trade. — I am, &c, July 30.

I have sold it from the very first, and hayo Bont it into every county in England and into many parts or Scotland. Well do I remember the first cir.cu.lar you sent out some nine or ten year* Bgo. You hud come to England from America to introduce Mother Beigel's Cura tive Syrup, and I was strnok by a paragraph in which you used those words:—"" Being a stranger in a strange land, I do not wish the people to feel that I want to take the loast advantage over them, I feol that I havo a remedy that will oure disease, and I have so much confidence in it that I authorise my agents to refund the money if people should gay that they have not benefited by its use."" I felt atonoe tbatyou would never say that unless the medioino had merit, and I applied for the agency, a step which I now look baok upon with pride and Bitisfabtioc; Ever since that time I have found it by far the beet, remedy for Indigestion and Dyspepsia I have met with, and I have scld thousands of bottles. It has never failed in any case where there were any of the following symptoms:—Nervous or six headache, sour ness of the stomaeb, rising of the food after aaMnp, a flense of fumesss and heaviness, dizziresß, bad breath, slime and mucous on the gums and teeth, constipation, and yoliowness of the eyes and skin, dull and sleepy sensations, ringing in the ears, heart bum, loss of appetite, and, in short, where over there are signs that the system is clogged, and the blood is out of order. Upon repeated inquiries, covering a great variety of ailments, my customers have always answered, ""|I am better,"" or ""I am perfectly well,"" What I have seldom or never seen bsfore in the esse of any medicine is that the people tell each other of its virtues, and those who have been ourod say to the suffering: ""Go and get Mother Beigel's Curative Syrup, it will make you well."" Out of the hundreds of cures I will nemo one or two that happen to come into my mind. Two old gentlemen, whose names they would not like me to give you, had been martyrs to Indigestion and Dyspepsia for many years. They had tried all kinds of medicine without relief. One of them was so bad that he oould not bear a glass of ale, Both wero advised to use the Syrup and both recovered, and were as hale and hearty as mon in the prime of life. A remarkable case is that of a house painter named Jeffries, who lived at Pens hurst, in Kent. Hib businesa obliged him to expose himself a great deal to wind and weather, and he was seized with rheumatism, and hio joints soon swelled up with dropsy, and were very stiff and painful. Nothing that the doctors could do seemed to reach the seat of trouble. It so orippled him that he could do hardly any work, and for the whole of the winter of 1878 and '79, he had to give up and take to his bed. He had beon afflioted in this sorry way for threo years, and was getting worn out and disoouraged. Beside?, he had spent over £l 3 for what he called ""dootor's stuff"" without the loast benefit. In the Spring he heard of what Mother Beigel's Curative Syrup h»s done for others and bought a2s 6d bottle of me. Iu a few days he sent ms word he was much better—before ho had finished the bottle. He then sent to me for a 4;. 6d. bottle, and as I was going that way 1 carried it down to him myself. On gettiug to his house what was my astonishment and surprise to fiad him out in the garden weeding an onion bed. I could hardly believe my own eves, and said . ""■ You ought not to be out here, man, it may be the death of you, after being laid up ell winter with rheumatism and dropsy."" Hie reply waß:—"" There is no danger. The weather is fine, and Mother Beigel's Curative Syrup has done for me in a few days what the doctors could not do in three years, I think I shall get well now."" He kept on with the dyrup, and in three weeks he was at work again, and has had no return of the trouble for now nearly ten years. Any medioine that can do this should be known all over tho world* Yours faithfully. (SigDed) RtfPEKT GrBAHAH, Op Graham & Son. Holloway Houso, Snubury, Middlesex, June 25th, 1887.

351,1876-02-17,AS,Auckland Star,19,MR SINGLETON ROCHEFORT AND CITY WEST.,"(To the Editor of the Evening Star.) Sir, —My intention of becoming a candidate for Auckland City West, in the event of Sir George Grey resigning his seat for it, has been already made known through your columns. It is mentioned in the Herald of the 14th that Messrs Clark, Farnall and Tonks will be, according to report, candi dates for the same seat, and that an election requisition in favor of one of those gentlemen is being got up. This practice, under our pre sent mode of voting, is most objectionable. It was revived duriog the late elections by the Bask of n ew Zealand in favor of one of its own members, who was a candidate for Auckland City East. To trade in money and negotiable securities, is the legitimate busi ness of a banking company. So long a. its operations are confined to transactions of that nature, it may be useful to the community wherein it has been established ; but whenever it deparrs from it to intermeddle in politics, its usefulness becomes impaired, if not de stroyed. Erom matters brought to light, through the exertions of Sir George Grey during the late session of the Assembly, and from the disclosun-s made by Mr Bridges be fore afcommittee of the House of Represen tatives, it would appear that the Bank of New Zealand is the de facto government of the colony ; that those who, since June or July, 1869, have styled themselves "" Ministers of the Crown,"" were or are, ia reality, tbe men of business and puppet, of the Bank, and that its direotora have power to exalt and to'abase, to appoint and .o move to ruin and to enrich, as to then) T _iy seem gOod. This certainly is not |-*\_ hy Btate of things. Until very recent!; t „.lic elec tions in England were conducted by oral voting J the ©lector appearerl at the polling, booth, and declared aloud the name of the candidate for whom he wished to re oord his vote. Under this mode of proceeding, electors who were depend, ent upon or in the power of others h»d to endure much hardship and oppression. The tyrant-landlord would insist upon big tenants voting as he should dictate, or upon hi3.vacating his farm. The manufacturer and the master-tradesman used to act inasimila. manner towards their workmeD, and so did the cold and crafty creditor * towards his debtor. After an agitation of many years, the ballot—secret voting—was substituted in its stead, and with beneficial results. The object of it ia that men may vote as they think fit and proper, without being subject to the dictation, importunity, or influence of others, and that one man may not know for whom another haa voted. Now all this ig frustrated by getting electors to sign requ.. sitions, and by candidates or their friends canvassing for votes. _ The practice is not only improper, but it is by no means clear that it is not an illegalty for which the Queen might institute a criminal suit, as it tends to render nugatory an act passed, not for the private convenience of individuls, but for a public purpose, namely, to ensure to all electors a full, unshackled liberty in exercising the elective franchise. During my residence in Melbourne, I had a vote for the election of members of both Bouses of the local legisla. tri>e of Victoria. If any person, at an elec tion, ever asked tne for whom I intended voting, the invariable reply was, "" That is a secret."" I made it my duty to make enqui. ries respecting the capacity and morality of the candidates, and, at the proper time and place, I voted for the one whom I deemed tho most fit. I never thought by so doing I was conferring a favour upon him, but simply that I had discharged my duty. The elec tive franchise is a trust reposed in us, and, as in the case of all trusts, it, is to be exercised with honour and integrity, and with an eye to the puMic good. I will solictt no man for his vote, because I do not think it would be right to do so I trust the electors of Auck land City West will have sufficient self, respect and sense of duty to refuse to affix their signatures to any requisition, or to .promise their votes to any candidate or other person soliciting the same, and that they will, at the proper time and place, exercise, free from all trammels, the trust reposed in them for the public welfare.

THE GREYMOUTH RAILWAY DEPARTMENT WAR Hostilities between the Greymouth Borough Council and the Railway department have broken out again over the old trouble— lights in dark places. The city fathers want the railway authorities to light up at their own cost their railway station, but they can't sec their way to do so, aud told the civic powers so in no very measured language either. Added to that the Railway department has taken to blocking up a certain portion of Grey's main street called Upper Mawhera Quay by leaving trains across it, as a sort of cockerel de fiance, so now all the righteous blood of the Sheedys and the Campbells and tbe Belh is up, and the next time a carriage wheel is found tres pussing or running too quickly over any borough way— why, they are to be flattened out into road metal and all the officials arc to be put on the roads to break it !

The We3tland Agricultural and Pastoral Asso ciation, a moat useful body, which amongst other matters has been agitating for the opeuing up of the rich agricultural lands in the Whilcombe Valley, has at length been so far rewarded as to extract a promise from the Minister for Lands that a sum of money would ba placed on the Estimates for widening the Kokatahi road, and that the Whitcombe Valley track would be taken in hand immediately. The only other matter that the farmers of this thriving district yearn for is local self-government in the way of a road board. In the year 1890 Mr Seddon told the folk down this way that if a change in the present form of local self-government was to be made he favoured the form of the road board system in lieu of county council rule. Perhaps hfis still of the same opinion. We shall learn next week, as, replying to the mayor of the Ross Borough Coun cil, he says ke will forward copies of his Local Self-governing Bill as soon aa it is printed. YE GAME OP YE FOOTS VLtE.

109,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,36,Rabbit Poisoning and Preserving.,"TO THB EDITOB. Sir, — I wish to thank you again for publish ing my letters, bat I regret that you could not flnd room for the explanation in regard to the letter dated May 5 -namely, that it was re turned at the time to be better written iv ink instead of in pencil, as it lcoVs queer Jo see a letter published in July and dated May. Well, with your permiseion I will now refer to the eubjecb again. I sea by your paper of the 18th ult. that a correspondent, a Mr Sim, says that the rabbits have been lrapp€d off quite thin in his district for the Duuback factory. Well, that is a dear proof that the factory has helped to destroy rather than to preserve tha rabbits, as the poisoning can follow after ; bub he ia tho first person that I have read of in tha Witness having a good word to say for freezers or factories He winds up with the general cry for Government taxes to help the thing on. Well, I would like to osk him why all of us who are out of work, or have had bad luck of any kind cannot have a cut in as well as landowners or factories ; and a man who has gob a goo 3 block of land knows where to get his breakfast or dinner without having to swag for it, or even go to the soup kitchen, if he does have to keep a few rabbite. But in regard to the frtezers and factories, I think they would get along well enough without any help if the landowners would only give the trappers a chance to run ' the traps over and take the thick of the rabbits off before they ttart with the poiion. Bat this year pollard poison was uced indiscriminately nearly everywhere early in the seasoD, and some would not evf n give trappers a show at all. la {he district tbat I have been in I only know ■ three or four who had many rabbits who did nob try it in April, and yet the writers to the papers have the temerity to say ""that the rab bits are preserved for the factories. Well, now I wish to wfer to your former cor respondent, Mr Bryoe. lam surprised at him for writing such a letter, as if be had rough ground or thick bu«h to deal with he would find tbat he could not; get the doe rabbits out 9* thin as he describes, even if he paid £5 per doe rabbit (and not even with pollard poison) ; and if he did not pay for the bucks he would hire to pay extra for the does in proportion. But now I come to the most difficulb pomt — viz., bow is he going to get the money P I could give him a litMe information on that point. It is this : How very anxious many people are in spring time (when the skins are almost •worthless) to pay even the small price of Id per rabbit, and get ""f he skins themselves in cluded. I now conclude, although I should like to refer to the subject again later on. — I •bo, &0., Winton, July 30. F. PbrrtA P.S.— I would like to add that I heard lant liarvest that a party of business men were going to start freezing rabbits at the BluS to send Home on spec, but gave it upon account of the fear that the general use of the pollard poison at the time would prejudice the sale of the rabbits at Home when they arrive there. — F.

112,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,39,Vine-growing in Central Otago or the Dunstan District.,"TO THE EDITOR. Sir, — I wa3 very pleased to see that MrC. Iversen had replied to your corif spondent and given him the ""gruel"" he was entitled to. It was quite evident that his knowledge of fruit-growing or vine-growing on this particular occasion does not go for much by the remarks he made in his letters. lam of opinion that your correspondent would not know a sweet grape vine from a dessert or ordinary wine grape if he were to see them growing aide by side. However, I will ask him one question and I will be satisfied, and he can ask me any question he likes. The question is, What is a grape vine?— not merely its botanical name, Vitis vinifera, but the N.O. and root. lam sure, as Mr Ivewen s*ys, his letter on fruit-growing will be very interesting. I have had 17 years' experience in fruit-growing — fire in the old country, 10 in New South Wales (Parramatta), and two in New Zealand, so that I am talking, or can talk, on practical experience. I will give you an essay on the quince next week, and your cor respondent can have a go at it if he cares to do so.— l am, (fee, Robert M'Meeking.

199,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,126,THE STUDENTS OF TRUTH.,"ANOTHER SPLIT IN THE CAMP. A few weeks ago (says Ihe Lyttelton Timrs) Mr A. Bentley Worthiogton, the leicher of the b' dy known as the Students of Truth, paid a visit to Australia, and ever since his return it h&s been freely stated that he was about to be married to a young vromtn, a resident of this city. All doubt as to the truth of the rumour was set at rest at the usual weekly meeting on Thursday evening, by Mr Worthington announc ing his approaching marriage. Having made the announcement, he was about to close the meeting, when Mr George Simpson, who has been closely associated with Mr Worthington in the teaching for a considerable time, mounted the platform and essayed to speak, bat was prevented from doing so by Mr Worthington, and was promptly ejected from the building, as was also a lady Student who wished to pro.test against the marriage. Mr Simpson and several ottwr leading Students then held a meeting, aud it was decided to form an iudopendent society of the Students of Truth in order to cany on the ttavhing In the meantime Mr Worthington called upon the Rev. W. Birch, «nd lequested him to per* form the marriage set vice on the following Tuesday, and this gentleman tbinkrag that he wu bound by his license to marry any couple \»ho applied to him, reluctantly agreed to undertake the ceremony. Not being quite satitfied as to his position in the matter, how ever, he consulted authorities, with tbe result that he - sent the following letter to Mr Worthingfcon- :— Thuriday Morning. Dear Sir,— lt has been Stated to me on authority that there are legal impediments in the United Sbateß, and I was re quested to refer to the United States Consul in Auckland, who, it is said, is in a position to show that legal impediments do exist. The generally accepted opinion is that Biater Magdala stands bsfore the world as your wife, and it would be morally wrong for you to marry another woman during her life. In these circumstances I could not perform the ceremony of marriage on your behalf, and at the earliest moment I inform you of thiß. — Yours, &c., W.' Birch, Pastor. To this Pastor Birch received the following Temple of Truth, Chriatchurch, N.Z. My Dear Brother, — Your» of this date, declin ing to perform my marriage ceremony, is le reived. In reply, permit me to »ay there is no impedi ment, Ugal or otherwise, to such marrisge, or I assure you I would not put myself into the hands of such enenaie3. The United States Courul at Auckland can have no such information, as is stated to you, and the official opinion you quote re Sister Mugdala is a very weak one, however official. Much as I regret the awkward incident, believe me, my dear Bir, when I say I would much prefer your declination than your officiating under any mental reservation as to tbe moral question. Hie registrar will act for me — Sincerely jours, A. B. Worthington. It was curreatly reported iv town on Satur day that Mr Worthingten had be*n united to the lady by the registrar, but whether this is true or not; has. bob y*t been ascartxined. Suffice it to say that Mr Werbhington, with the lady amd Mr Duggan, paid a visit to the regis trar's office on S»turd»y, and remained there for some little time, -lha statement that the marriage has t*ktn place ia dwiied by .several of thtse who temain faithful to tae teacher. At (ho temple on Suaday morning there was a fair attendance, but it was 'evident -that the majwity had been attracted by curiosity. Shortly after tbe proceedings commenced a lady was pjeefced, and a considerable number of petsoDs soon gathered outside, a rumour having spread that she had arrived from Sydney to object to the marriage. Upon bang interviewed, however, the lady said she had bctn connected with the Students ever since the inception of the society. 6he said it was her ibtention to do her best to prevent the marriage taking place' until Sister Magdala, who hi now in Sydney, should have time to return and prottst on her own behalf. During the afttrnoon a request was sent to the police ttation for constables to be present at tht eve»i»g service, as it was feared that this lady might make herself objectionable. How evsr, she did not return, and although a good many pe*ple gathered outside the temple, the proceedings passed off quietly. The autry ia tbe Christchuivh registrar's office of the mtrriage which has led to as other split in the Temple of Truth shows the con tracting partiei to have been Arthur Bently Wortaingbon, aged *8, teacher of Truth, bachelor, born in New York, the son of Arthur jßently Woi thing ton, banker, of New York, and Florenca Worthington, net Bently— Bvaline Maud Jordan, spinster, aged 29 years, daughter of James Winfield Jordan, draper, of Sydenham, , and Ellen Theresa Jordan, nee Btittan.",1,0.918484179,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1889-04-09,TEML,Temuka Leader,5,PARNELL V. THE TIMES.,"London, April 5. In h'3 address before the Times-Parnell Commission to-day, Sir Charles Russell justified the system of boycotting within limits, and gave as an instance the Aus tralian colonies boycotting Government officials until the deporting of convicts ceased. He promised to produce the books of the National League. Sir Charles Russell, continuing his speech baforo the Commission, stigmatised the Attornoy-Gonerid’s conduct in bring ing charges of complicity in murder against Mr Parnell, without eyidanco to support them, as unworthy of a member of the bar. ... . : . THE TIMES APOLOGY. The following telegrams dated London, February 27th, appeared in a ’Frisco paper: The Times to day in its leading editcml anoles in full the apology tendered by Attorney-General Webstar before the Par nell Commission for the publication of the forged letters, and oontiones—“ We desire to endorse as appropriate every word of the foregoing statement. Moreover, Mr Parnell having in the witness box statad that the letters are forgeries, wo accept in every respect the truth of that statement. In these circumstances we deem it right to express our regret, especially and sincerely , at having been induced to publish the letters as Mr Parnel 'a, or to use them in evidence against him. This expression cf rsgret includes also the letters falsely attributed to Mr Egan, Mr Davitt, and Mr O’Kelly. “ It is scarcely fitting now to enter into the circumstances under which we re ceived and published them. We are bound, however, to point out that Pigott was not the person with whom we com municated. Moreover, we must add that we believed the letters to be genuine until the disclosures made by Pigott on cross examination. It must bo evident to a'l reasonable persona that if a conspiracy existed the Times was victimised by and not a party to it. Eirors in judgment may have been committed, and for them the penalty must be paid. It must be clearly understood that what we have done is altogether upon our own motion, and our own responsibility, and in thu public interest alone. This withdrawal, ot course, refers exclusively to the letters obtained from Pigott.” The Daily Haws says: “The Times tried to destroy Parnell, Parnell has destroyed the Times. Never again shall any roan who respects himself read its base accusations without a smilo of lan guid disgust. The Times is no repre sentative of the English press. We do not hesitate to say that no other English paper would have been capable of en gaging in the abominable traffic which has led the Times to such a dismal depth of infamy.” Lincoln, Neb., Feb. 28. Patrick Egan confirms the story of the discovery of tU Pigott forgeries as tele graphed from London lost night. Egan says that he had known him to be a forger and swindler for twenty years.

301,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,228,What London Cabmen Spend On Their Hansoms.,"The cabmen of London, in the majority of ioftt»nce?, are distinguished by the manner in which thsy keep their vehicles in good, cleau condition. One cabby, who is often seen in Piccadilly, looks upon his horde and bar.som as his children, and takes as much c*re of them as if they were his kith and kin. A man of this kind may spend in a year something like £20 upon his hansom in order to make it attractive to the hirer. "" Daring the pnfit month,"" said a cabman to the writer, "" I have spent quite £2 in smarteu iDg up my hansom for the season. People like a clean cab, and, as some of our basses don't help us very much to make the hansoms look well, we have to do it for them. The £2 I've spent went in a- sun cover for the roof, flowers in the lamps, a little bit cf new harness, and a daily paper. A great many gentlemen regularly use my hansom, and I've found it pay well to keep a morning paper ready for 'em. ""A cabby I know carries one or two book novels, I think, and he passes these down to the psssfngers to read. But as he sometimes doesn'c get the books back, he loses money ou ifc. Another cabby friend of mine is thinking of going in for the electric light, both for his lamps and for his passengers to read by. It'll cost him a heap of money, and I don't see how he'll get it back. But the hansom's his own, so be isn't doing what some of us would have to do — improve our master's property at our own expense. "" There's a cab I sometimes see in Piccadilly in which the passenger generally finds a box of good Egyptian cigarettes, and a card over it ;aying, ' Pleas 3 take one.' The passenger can't take more, as the. box closes automati cally after a cigarette has been abstracted. I should think this man speuds about half a crown a week on this notion, but as he has a lot of Johnnies who use his cab, it pays him, no doubt. . "" It's only these cabbies who spend a little money on theic hansom and horso who can make things pay nowadays. The public won't have the ramshackle, dirty cad, driven by a seedy cove who doesn't seem to have had a wash for a week. No, the cabby who makes things hum is the man who dresses as a gentleman, and who behaves like one to his customers.""",1,0.841508684,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
356,1876-02-17,AS,Auckland Star,24,A Voice from Tapu Creek.,"IT TELLS THE STORY OF THAT RURAL SPOT. Hastings, (Tapu Creek), Feby 12th 1876 I conSIDICR it necessary in beginning my correspondence to give a short sketch of the rise and progress of this place. In November 1867 when gold was first discovered here by the Messrs Mclsaacs this place was only known to fame by readers of Maori history aa the scene of one of their bloody fights, and tbe burying place of the slain, one aide of the creek (Waipatukahau) and part of the other being tapued hence the name "" Tapu ' reek,"" On gold bring discovered here there was a freat lush, upwards ot two thousand bein. ere at one time, and the amount of alluvi.l gold that was obtained in the gullies and creek by the first prospectors seemed to warrant the rush. Shortly afterwards the Mclsaacs found their celebrated reef which gave such large returns, and enabled them to sell out for several thousands of pounds, it also gave a great impetus to prospecting and numerous leaders and reefs were found. The cry at that time was ""Oh : if we had only machinery to crush our quartz what a pile we would make."" Buildiugs were being erected rapidly ; we had no less than thirteen public houses, besides numerous places where sly grog waß sold. Buckland, Sanderson, the Auckland Engiueers, also l_angland'n Co-operatives were all erecting machines to crush the rich quartz for the miners and reap a golden harvest to then-selves, but alas ! "" the best laid schemes o' mice and men gang aft aglee,"" as aoon a. they started work they not only crushed the claims out of existence, but were likewise crushed so badly themselves, that three of the batteries changed owners, two of them being taken away from here. Now the miners began rapidly to leave this place until not more than ono hundred were left; houses were taken down and removed, and out of thirteen publicans eleven "" were not.'' Still thefe were a few who had faith in the ultimate prosperity of the place, and had adopted General Grant's saying as their motto ""keep pegging away."" One of these parties erected a four stamper battery in the ""Whalebone O.ek on a ciaim known as tbe ""Hope."" They had to erect two water wheels, one thitty the other twenty-four feet in diameter, to drive their four stampers (water being so scarce) For years they have been p gging away, they have ciu-hed thou sands of tons of quartz, for 1 dwt. to the ton generally have made wages, and are still sanguine that their pile is before them in the ground. If perseverance and indomitable pluck are necessary to success, then they are bound to suc ceed. Another company the "" Ballion"" (old Fall Moon) are deserving of praise for the great amount they expended in putting in a low level to work the Full Moon leader. After an expenditure of £3,000 in openiog np their ground they are about to reap the reward of their enterprise, the first crushing they had went ab^ut loz. to the ton, this week they finished a crushing of 28 tons for 20oz, sdwts. wiihout crashing the specimens, and exclusive of the gold that will be ob tamed from the blanketings, which I con sider will make the crushing worth loz. to the ton. They are also crushing from another leader, supposed to be the Hnlf Moon lead, which is expected to go at least l^oz to the ton This lead is id excellent Working country of good use, and from their main level they have over two hundred feet of backs, and when once their tramway is finished to the mill _?oz. to the ton would pay well. Another party of (six) enterpris ing men pegged off eleven men's ground nearly thiee years ago. During that time they were supported by Mr Buckland, who gave each £1 per week, besides finding all the mining requisites. They started to work to put id a low level underneath Buckland'a and the "" Little Jessie"" claims. They have driven over six hundred feet, two hundred of that being along the course of the reef, have put up a rise to within thirty feet from the surface in an immense body of quartz supposed to be ten feet thick, and con sidered to oe worth J> oz. to the ton. They have also an iron tramway between the mine and battery, a quarter of a mile in leugtb, and Buch ia the facility for working the mine that six men will be able to keep the battery of fifteen stamps ao work mghc and day, and 5 dwt. to the ton pay wages ana ftll necessary expense. Tney started crushing a few days ago, and I am happy to state with good payable results. In conclusion I may state that tbe people of ■Tapu are a naid-woikiug indusciious ...

331,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,18,POLITICAL INFLUENCE OF SOCIETIES.,"To tho Editor of the]TnAME3 ADVERTISER. Sin,—l will try to make clear the hazi ness "" Uncle John "" complains of with your permission, and wish some abler pen would come to the rescue, for I wish to make men think and study what is good for all. I have;.said:the balloting system is a farce, and complain of its being so because the Government uphold it, that Government being governed not by the people, as they are led to believe it is, but by a part of them formed into societies for their own particular benefit. We have all heard the saying,"" Birds of a feather flock together."",: -If the Govern ment want to give' people liberty to act according to their conscience, they would hot number the. balloting papers, for doing so causes some men belonging to these societies to vote against their in clination, for necessity has no law, and when a member of a society is asked for a voto for so and so, and promises to give it, he knows if he does not do so, the paper being numbered, he may lose, his situation or get no work. The chances are, his necessity will'overcome his scruples (if he has any); so that I say parties that uphold this system are not liberty-loving, and especially when it' is considered the means taken to uphold this power, for generally it-is not known to outsiders that so-and-so is a member of a secret society. He comes before the public as a most disinterested man, as thoroughly independent of party or society. A lie to .begiu with.',' If he belongs to one of them, the consequence is a great many,.seeing,so many voting and upholding this man, say as they say and do as they do, especially if they are strangers; and when these men aro re-, turned by societies, they use the number ing of the balloting papers to keep them in power. A question of importance arises; a member wants to carry a point —wautspublic pressure to boar on it; he Bends to a society man (may be a paid one, on purpose), ono who has the confi dence of the members most likely (and very likely theso.mombers do not know, and would not back him if they did know ho was paid to use his influence to get their votes), and the numbering of tho papers takes a great deal of the liberty away from tho rotors. I have, taken up too much space now, and am very well aware (in somo societies' ideas) of all 1 deserve for daring to have any liberty of conscience; but the subject is only hintod at, hardly touched. Yet there is tho social, moral, and tho livo and let live side of tho question; if anyono ha 3 the ability to take it up; I certainly do not lack will, but feel my utter inability to deal with this, question as it should be— I am, &c.

Coincident with the de velopment of the industry by Mr Zi man's exten sive prospecting echemes, it has been pointed out that c uindence is being destroyed in the various mining undertakings by what is termed the ""johbjug""of certain people under the guise of shartibroking, and to prevent sharebrokers in future from dealing in shares a very stringent clause has bsen added to the Mining Companies Act Amendment Bill by the Goldfields Committee of the Council. The clauae is almost certain to be carried by the Council, and I have the strongest reasons to believe that when the amendment is referred back to the House (through which the bill has already passed) it will bo approved of and will be- com 0 law. I have been enabled t j secure an early copy of the clause, and considering its vital importance as far as miuing is concerned, I send it in ex'enso as follows :—: — ""1. From and after the commencement of this act (a) no sharebroker on account of his wife or of any member of hi* family, or of any clerk or ser vant in bia employ, Bhall in any way, directly or indirectly, buy, sell, deal in, or become the holder of any shares of «t"">ck in any mining company registered or incorporated under the principal act or ' The Companies Act 18S2 ' ; (b) every instru ment of sale or transfer of any such shares or stock executel after the commencement of this act by any sharebroker or his wife, whether as trsnsferer or transferee, is unlawfully executed, and shall be absolutely void for all purposes ; (c) no transf«r of any shares or stock in any such company to or from a sharebroker or his wife shall be registered in the book* of such company ; (<Z) every person who, without lawful excuse (the proof whereof shall lie on him), shall commit any breach of any of the provisions of this section is liable to a penalty not exceeding, for the fivnt offence, £10, and for every subsequent offence £100. "" It is a lawful excuse if (a) the share? or stock sold or held in breach of sub-clause A of sub- Eection 1 were acquired before th« commencement of this. act, or i i(b) the instrument of sale or transfer executed in breach of sub-clause B of the same sub-section is so executed for the purpose of completing any binding contract entered into before the commencement of this act or disposing of any stock or shares acquired before the com mencement of this act ; or if (c) the person register ing the transfer in breach of sub-clause C of the same sub-section did not know, and had no reasonable causa to believe, that such transfer was executed by a sharebroker or his wife or that the execution was in any other respect a breach of this section. "" For the purpose of this section sharebrokor means any person who carries on the business of buying, selling, or traffi -.king in shares or stock on commission or brokerage, or who in any way holds himself out to the public as a sharebroker. Auckland, August 3. At a meeting of ths Auckland Stock and Share brokers' Association a resolution was passed strongly protesting against the proposed new clauees in the Mining Companies Act Amend ment Bill having reference to sharebrokers.

8,1889-04-09,TEML,Temuka Leader,9,"The Temuka Leader TUESDAY, APRIL 9, 1889. MR FISHER’S RESIGNATION.","Mb Fisheb’s resignation reached the Premier at half past nine o’clock on Sunday evening. It is surmised that the resignation will be covered by a review of the difference which has arisen between himself and his fellow Ministers, ■ which will doubtless be published in the course of time, and prove interesting reading. The Evening Post says:—“The circum stances which have led to Mr Fisher’s retirement are not in full as yet public property, but it is understood that they embrace a much wider range of differences than any personal dis agreement or paltry dispute about excise prosecutions. Mr Fisher is understood to have consulted political friends in various parts of the colony as to his position in the matter, and he has acted in accordance with their advice.” We have no doubt Mr Fisher will do bis best to pose as a martyr to his principles, and try to make it appear that he has sacrificed himself in the interest of the public. It is possible he may have been sacri ficed by Ministers to suit their own ends, but that Mr Fisher sacrificed himself to the public good we doubt. He was elected to oust Sir Harry Atkinson from office. He did so, but took a band in ousting every Ministry who subsequently took office until be became himself a Minister, with Sir Harry Atkinson as his chief. Had Mr Fisher been left out of the Ministry when Sir Harry Atkinson took him in he would have been fighting against the Ministry ever since, and it was said at the time that Sir Harry had to give him a portfolio to shut his mouth. Mr Fisher poses as a Liberal, but throughout his career he has proved himself treacherous to the cause. He would be anything that would pay him, and the last thing he would think of is to sacrifice himself to the public good. It is no use speculating on Mr Fisher’s motives or intentions. He has resigned, and if we mistake not he will hold up the corrupt character of his colleagues in a light that will result in their ultimate discomfiture. Devoid of all sense of responsibility Mr Fisher is exactly the man to do everything in his power, without being over-punc tilous as to accuracy, ,to wreak vengeance on those who deprived him of his position. The' Wanganui Herald, of which Mr Eallance is editor, says that from a private received from Christchurch it le ,rns that the quarrel between,?Ministers arose out of the following circum stances : Mr Fisher Apeeired to prosecute a merchant, who had been detected Shannon in defrauding the Mr Stevens, one of rvho lives in wires with the result was not allowed as he desired. s a brewer in the beer duty Ministers de cided that he slßld be prosecuted, but Mr Fisher compromised the mat ter by taking from the brewer the amount he was supposed to have defrauded the revenue of. Mr Fisher was Commissioner of Customs, and this was in his department, and it was certainly a most extraordinary thing to prevent him prosecuting the man who defrauded the Customs in Christchurch and to insist upon his prosecuting the Wellington brewer, who probably is one of his personal friends. If all this is true, it is one of the most disgustingly dirty trans actions we have beard of and shows the corruptness of our governors. In all probability Mr Fisher will soon “let the cat out of the bag,” and give us a glimpse behind the scenes. . i«,i»nM m inn—WMiM—",1,0.763571464,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/temuka-leader/1889/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

128,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,55,THE MINERS' ASSOCIATION.,"TO THE EDITOR. Sir, — Having seen in yesterday's Daily Times a letxr signed "" Fred Daw,"" I wish to say that I quite agree with what the writer says as to the back creeks, and there can, in my opinion, be no doubt that in the. case of the goldfields thab could be gob at, and where any tall wa9 available, no labour or expense and practicil experience has been spared to work them ; therefore I think there would ' be very little hope of success in fossicking on these Gelds, The question now is, Where are the most likely places for the Miners' Associa tion to send oub bhe unemployed to work wh*re tbere is a likelihood of immediate return p There is no doubt bhe places available through the goldfields are chiefly those thab had to be passed over by the experienced diggers through being water-locked. Thesa are flats with no fall, which in hundreds of place 3 are known to contain gold through deep bodies of wash, bub too web to work. I have expended much money and time in experimenting and complet ing light, oimple, and cheap machinery for dredging by horse-power to cope with the difficulty of working the flats and river beds under water from the banks and washing through the still water, thus saving tho great expense and time of bringing up tail races, Ice. The total weight of the plant is aboub lOcwb, in portable sections. It will sink in any ordi nary fiab, and briDg ashore, washed, about 100 tons of gravel per eight hour* wibh bwo horses. It can be set to work when on the claim in about two hours, is handily shifted, and easy to manage. I would strongly recom mend the association to purchase one of these machines as a test. If they do so I would un dertake to set the machine to work, and if found payable I would undertake to supply the association at a very low price and easy terms, and would pub them to work on the various places as may be agreed upon. Each machine to work 16 hours — two shifts — would require from seven to eight men and four horses. The work ing parts of this new machine I fthou'.d be glad to show at work at any time. — I am, &c, R Cockereli,. Albany place, No. 4, off Kiog street, Dun edin, July 31. TO THE EDITOR. Sib, — To my mind better results would be obtainable if the mining parties were not sent out until the -warm summer weather sets in. Much reference has been made to similar expeditions in New South Wales, but there is a great difference in prospecting in cold, bleak, treeless South Otago and that colony, where fossickers can nearly always get abundance of firewood, which is half the battle when camping out in-tenbs. At Toolong, near Kiandra, where the cold was 10 Jeg below zero a few days ago, several miners have been snowed up, doing nothing for three months, but as they are in the midst of magnificent iron and stringy bark timber they have cosy little huts built to withstand the cold. Plenty of poor men go fossicking at Wyalong 1 , the last discovered goldfield, and can live com fortably in tents there because ib is surrounded with a dense pine scrub, and the miners can have roaring fires these frosty nights. The Argus states that numbers of poor, half-starved creatures can be seen toß&icking abonb the gullies near Clunes, Creswick, and BilHrat, ground which has been tried over and over again. Many old miners, if they only made tucker, would sooner potter about the old fields than work for wages. No better example of perseverance could be cited than that of the Dmjleßford miner who laboured in the same gully for 30 years at a small remuneration, and was lucky enough lasb year to strike it rich, and is now worth thousands of pounds. Blest people have heard of the hard luck of the poor selector Gordon, who sold his ground to prospectors for £1 per acre, and ou which was discovered the richest mound of gold in the world — Mount Morgan. — I am, &c., Dunedin, July 31. 8 2 (L",1,0.565625995,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1870","For the cause that lacks as'""' For the wrong that - _^tan_9, For the futu— -«e<IS resistance, Ap-' -»«n tne distance, -*i the _ood that we can do. Let not the stranger in the land nor the sojourner within our streets take the demon stration of this morning as a measure of our 1 oyalty. We regret that it wns so, but. the causes are not far to seek. We yesterday referred to the intentional iosultoffend to the people of Auckland through their Chief Magistrate. That tie people attribute this conduct to the instigation of the hated Dr. Pollen was evident enough to-day, and h.id it not been for the expectation of meeting tho Minister and giving him a thundering reception, there would probably not hove been twenly persons, save official, at the rail way station. Where ia the Doctor ? Where is Soapy Dan? r.n from mouth to mouth, and the disappointment Yt-nted itself in peeping into the empty carriage windows and in the suspicions expressed that ' c q na( j bidden himself under the '_e_ts. We rep rat for the sake of. i_fa Excellency, who is probably wholly xnho.en. of blame, tha. a U tL.is (occurred, and it is in the fe.cpe that he will take the oppor tunity of exonerating himself from any personal share in the insult that we re turn to the slight, given to the people, and that we mean to keep pegging at it until Honour is given to whom honour is due "" It is under this motto that our ministerial contemporary the Cross this morning speaks as follows :—"" We are informed, that due official notification was made to his Honor the Superintendent of the proposed visit of his Excellency the Governor, and the day of his arrival in the province."" This is simply a deliberate and wilful lie. We see no reason for usiDg a mincing term. The state ment is utteily false, an:l we are astounded that our contempoiaty would dare to make it. We have been at tho pains to make investigation of the sulject, and this is the result. Never once before—we believe we can say it without any qualification—has a ny Governor visited the province of Auck -1 and without an autograph letter proceeding direct from the Governor to the Superin tendent intimating to him personally the intended visit. This is the accepted rule, and has not heretofore been omitted. On the present occasion the first communication on the subject was a semi private note from Mr Tonka the Mayor, to Sir George Grey, as follows :— ""My Dear Sir George,—The Governor will anive in this city to-morrow, landing at Railway Station at 10i o'clock a.m. Ms Mayor, I suppo.e it is my duty to greet him on his arrival, and I thai! take it as a favor if you will accompany me. An early answer will oblige. Yonrs faithfully, B. Tonks.— 16th Febiuary, 1876. To this his Honor replied as follows this morning ; — "" My Dear Tonks,—Thank yon for your note, wtiich I only received late last night I have not received any intimation of the arrival of the Governor, nor an in.itatu n to wait upon him. I should fear to intrude un asked. Faithfully yours, G. Grey. Feb. 17, 1876."" One word of comment on the foregoing is wasted. If his Worship had received any offi cial communication from Ministers, it was very carefully veiled in his letter, most probably with the intention of not wounding the feelings of the Superintendent, for none respects Sir George Grey more than does Mr Tonks. But the invitation to "" accompany "" the Mayor was one that would by anyone be interpreted into a private and kindly-intentioned desire that Sir George Grey should not be left out in the cold. Furthermore it might have been natural to suppose that from the absence of the usual intimation his Excellency bad d.sired his advent to be of a strictly private and unofficial kind, and to our mind ib would have seemed an intrusion had the Superintendent pre sented h mself "" accompanying "" the Mayor. But the true facts of the case are now cub. It appears that Ministers tele graphed to Mr F. Whitaker coming events ca sting their shadows before. He was requested to placo himself in communication —not with the Superintendent, but with the M-vyor, and with him to arrange for the recepbion of Hi 3 Excellency. Mr Tonks appaiently fell into the snare which shows that the heads of the most sentible men can be turned by a little honour. Him we entirely exculpate from participation n this affront td Sir George Grey, but that ia gross and deliberate insult was intended t and given to the Superintendent of the pro -1 vince is beyond any question. That, the bitter and insidious enemy of Auckland, Dr. Pollen, was the instigator of it we are perfectly sure, but we are unxious to know if it was with the consent or approval of the Governor himself. To his Excellency we respectfully appeal for informal ion on this subject. We shall be deeply grieved if he should be un just y under the charge of manifesting a political bias and reflecting the hostility of his responsible advisers towards a man who for his brave defence of all that is honest and true lives in the hearts of the people of Auckland. That informa tion can be officially intimated through either of the morning papers if we from our freedom of speech are considered undeserving of it. But we would with the very greatest respect say that on it will depend to a very large extent the nature of the relations t_3t will exist between the people of Auckland and the Governor during his sojourn here, whether that may be long or abort. We shall return to th_3 suhj >ot to morrow.",1,0.453932203,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/auckland-star/1876/02/17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,12,WAIWERA SCHOOL.,"Report : of the Waiwera School Committee for the year ending 10th January 1870. On the 11th day of January, 1870, '■here was a meeting held in Mr Scott's Hotel, of householder-* in the district, for the purpose of electing a School Committee when the following were chosen : — Messrs James Scott, Samuel Broad, David M'Kenzie, William Brooks, David Wallace, William Littlejohn, and Campbell Thomson. At a subsequent meeting, it was thought advisable to strike out Mr Littlejuhn's name from the list of members of Com mittee as he became the successful ten derer for the erection of the school buil ding. Since then we have to report the following progress :— At the time of the election of the present Committee, there beitig no school house, but a tormer Com mittee having commenced operations in the way of getting plans and specifications, securing site for school, calling for tenders and other necessary arrangements, it was left to us to carry out those arrangements. ""We therefore met on the 2 1st January to open the tenders, when that of Mr Little johu was accepted, his being the lowest tender. The amount of the tender was L 145 15s, and with some extra work which was absolutely necessary to get done his account amounted to L 154 10s ; and we have every reason to congratulate ourselve9 on the choice we made, as the work was done in a moat satis factory manner. We may also mention here that Mr Littlejohn supplied the forms and desks free of cost. The amount received from the Government towards the erection of the building was Ll5O. The amount of the tender above-mentioned did not include cartage, which was supplied by several of the settlers in the neighbor hood, who sent teams to Tapanui for the timber. The bricks for the chimneys were supplied by Mr Telfori, and the chimneys we*e erected by Mr Broad, free of cost. On the 19th day of March, the Committee met to consider the appointment of school master, and, after due consideration, the present schoolmaster, Mr Hay, was chosen. The Sehoolhouse was opened on the 23 rd of April by a lecture volunteered by the Rev Charles Connor. At this lecture there was a collection made in aid of the School Funds, when the amount of L 6 K)s 6d was gathered, and we have since received L 3 sterling privately. The state of the funds as they stand at present are as follows : — Dr. Against; which 1 am sorry to say there is a much higher amount standing, namely Mr Littlejohns' account for black board, new desk, and other work, L 2 8s 6d ; Messrs i Fish and Son's account for paper and lining, jLI 11s lpd; amounting to ... £4 0 4 Besides which there is a piece of fencing be tween Mr Pagan's and the school land, which has been erected, it amounts to L 5 3s ; making in all nine ponnds odd to pay, and to meet which there is only Ll Is 9d in hand ; but we may mention that we have got the promise of six pounds but have not as yet received it. Witu regard to the progress of the School, we have to report as follows : — The number of the pupils who have attended school have been 19, one of whom has left. The average attendance for the year has been eleven The different branches in which they are engaged are as follows : — Two are learn ing monosyllables or letters, twelve reading easy narratives to the 6th book, five reading books of general information, fourteen learn ing to write from copy on paper, six learning to write from dictation on slate or paper, seven learning the four simple rules of arithmetic, three learning the four com pound rules of arithmetic, four learning as far as proportion and practice, five learning geography, five learning English grammar, two learning drawing and mapping, one learning Latin. The amount of fees received ... L 5 17s 5d The amount of fees due ... L3l6*ld £9 13s 6d The Schoolmaster's salary is LIOO per annum, towards which the Government give L 75, which leaves L 25 to be found in the district. The school fees will go some way towards that, but still there will be a con siderable amount to make up, and as there are many in the district who have not as yet, either in money or labor, given anything towards the school, we trust they will now come forward and relieve the Committee from the responsibility of this debt. The school up to this time has prospered as well, if not better, than wo could have expected, and we Took for an increased attendance as soon as the bridge across the Waiwera is completed. C. Thomsok. It has been jocosely said that bigamy is a crime which carries its own punishment with it. The bachelor's point of view is possibly an amusing one, but when the offence cornea to be seriously regarded it is apparent , that there are few known to the law of a more villanous and despicable character. The re cords of the Supreme Court during the past week have made public a cue of bigamy re sulting in m_>re than the usual misery. The bigamist, named John William Manuel, was married under hk real designation in Eng land in 1858, and having come to this colony without his wife, was married again at Kil more in 1867, under the slightly changed name of John William .Emanuel. The evi dence brought against him was conclusive, and the jury experienced no difficulty in ar? riving at a decision. But no punishment inflicted on him can afford the slightest re paration for the wrong he has perpetrated. The unhappy victim of his baseness has gone mad, and is now in a lunatic asylum. A touching scene was witnessed in court when the father of this unfortunate girl gave his evidence, and at the thought of all the misery which had come upon his family broke down and wept.— "" He and my daughter lived together.

85,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,12,OUR HOME AGRICULTURAL LETTER.,"(Fbom Oub Special Corbespondent.) Bradford, June 21. AN AMEHICAN AT/THOIUTY ON HOW TO SHIP CATTLE. Professor Henry, of the Wisconsin Experi ment Station in America, has lately given a few directions relative to the shipment of cattle, and as this is a ""live"" question in the colonies, a word or two"" cannot be out of plaoe. The golden rule in shipping all kinds of cattle is to get them as fast as possible from range, station, farm, or feed-yard to market. Since the invention of patent cars, parties a long distance from market have been greatly bene fited. One only needs to go down to the stock yards and see the cattle rolling in every day from points 1000 to 1500 miles west without unloading to find out how much better cattle shipped in this way look than those that have been knocked about at the local feeding points, and have had to be unloaded and loaded probably a couple of times be tween their point of shipment and their desti nation. The outward appearance is nothing to the inward look when the hide is eff and the bruises show up. I am of opiniou that all cattle, whether natives or ranges, should ba sent to market without unloading. We receive cattle every day from a distance of 1200 miles that stay in the cars all the distance. They are fed in the cars and watered also. The old-fashioned railroad feed yard is a thing of the past so far as its usefulness is concerned. Just as we be lieve it is better to kill cattle as near the feed yard or range as possible, so it is better to run them to the central markets with as little shrinkage as possible. Let as now face the subject of shipping. Grass cattle, as a rule, do not ship well. On the pasture they look well, aud many a buyer has been deceived by the appearance of a drove of steers in a green field with full bite. To ship such cattls is a bard task, and is invariably dis appointing, but it has to be done. When con venient it is a good plan to place such cattle in a pen* and feed them hay for a day or two. The secret of shippiog all classes of cattle is to place them on the cars full of feed, but with as little moisture as possible. If you ship a steer full of water he is apt to have loose bowels and show up in the yard badly. Properly bandied, cattle should arrive in the sale pens dry behind and ready for a good nil of water ; not over thirsty, but in a good condition to water freely. Many of our shippers think that by salting their cattle, or by feeding them oats, or by other scheming, they can fool the buyers. This is nonsense. The buyers are just as sharp as the owners, and while many of them say nothing we see them ride into a pen and out again without the cour tesy of a bid on this account. Dozens of times we have seen tbis happen. It always acts against the shipper to use unnatural means. To eastern buyers it is a matter of great im portance that cattle should be in good condi tion when purchased, so as to stand farther shipment. Whon cattle drink too freely they are apt to founder and break down. In this condition the dressed bsef men can use them, but it stops competition, and, as a natural con sequerce, cattle often go below their value when in condition. - The same rules apply to grain-fed cattle, whether in pasture or dry lot, as to the above ; only they are much more easily handled in ship ment, and do not show much distress in their changed circumstances. As to feed on the road, nothing equals good, sweet hay ; it beats corn or other grains because it is easily digested and does not fever the animal. Simple methods and simple feed are the best that can be used. A3 to water on the road, it is a matter to be decided on according to the weather. In midsummer care must be taken to supply animal wants, whereas in winter a steer can go for many hours without a drink. Good management in this line also calls for the arrival of stock at the yards in proper time. From 5 to 8 a.m. is the best time in the day to appear upon the seene — the nearer the latter hour the better, for cattle especially look better when they are taken off the cars and have just been fed and watered ; then they have a bloom upon them which wears off very quickly. LONDON WOOL SALES. - The gross arrivals for the fourth series of the above Bales, which opens on the 2nd prox. , hiving readied 400,000 bales, the list has been closed already, the quantities available for realisation during the forthcoming auctions being as fol lows :—: — Bales.

A large business has been doing in France and Germany, while in the home manufacturing districts, particularly as regards tho expor- 1 ; trade with tbe United States, growing activity is manifest. The consumption above referred to must, no doubt, be having an apparent effect upon the large quantity of low-priced wool accumulated in the past, snd »s a considerable portion of this is in manufacturers' hands they are at present able to cope with the increasing trade out of existing supplier, without for the moment being obliged to resoit either to the topmaker or the London market. Should, however, the present scale of employment of machinery be continued it muity sooner or later affect the prices of the raw material, although it is very difficult to say how soon this m»y occur."" The anomalous conditions which have pre vailed for the past month or six weeks of advanc ing prices for yarns and declining rates for tops and wool appear at last to have come to an end, as they were sure to do ere long one way or another. Values for 603 tops at the end of last week again touched the very lowest point of the late depresaioa ; bat this week this down ward tendency has received a distinct check, the trade mercury has visibly risen, and holders, finding more disposition on the part of con sumers to buy, are firmer in their quotations. The experience in the raw article during the pact few weeks has certainly been of a very novel character, and at first sight it appears very strange, for manufacturers, being full of orders for many months to come, had evi dently covered themselves in raw material and could afford to wait buying further, or perhaps, to put the matter more exactly, they had for tfc* present generally exhausted their capacity in this respect. However, these last few days our market haß been more lively, and there is an all-round recovery of firmness. In merinos there is a steady turnover, and prices are now again tending harder after this short pericd of partial depression. A like remark applies to cross bred *, though the latter are still considerably cheaper than similar grades in English tops. The consumption keeps very great, and although the next London sale compriees the enormous weight of 1,200,000 bales, after that there will not be a great deal left, and not since 1872 have Bradford spindles and looms been so busy. Be fore the immense development of the supply of merino wool from Australia and South Africa in the early part of June, when the new clip of wool was beginning to arrive here' from tho various country wool-growing districts, the whole wool trade was in a fctate of suppresed excitement, and rapid changes in prices caused by specu lators were by no meauß uncommon. Nowa days the advent of the new season's home-grown wool seems only to attract the very smallest degree of intereit, and, with the exception of the besb lustre wodl, which is slightly dearer, there is no change in the prices of other Eng lish kinds of wool. Mohair still keeps in the clouds, and 25d has been made this week where 24d was accepted last. And still there is some talk of a further advance, for while there is very great firmnesa in all departments of the mohair industry, some authorities are predict ing another jump in prices of at least 10 per cent, at an early date. This is the highest price mads since the palmy days of the seventies, and everything points to its continuance. Mohair spinners are all most heavily under order, some of them being engaged up to the end of the year, and none of the leading manu facturers of bright goods can undertake new orders for delivery until the late autumn. There is also a considerable quantity of mohair aud worsted yarns being exported, and also of wool. In the piece trade there are very healthy appearances and a largo trade is being done for the autumn season, whilst the demand for bright goods is steadily increasing.",1,0.405007969,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71,1896-11-09,OAM,Oamaru Mail,29,THE OTEKAIKE RIDING.,"TO THE EDITOR. Sir, —The ratepayers of the Otekaike riding have dared to hold a meeting with out first consulting Mr Duncan Suther land, and so Mr Duncan Sutherland is angry, and when Mr Sutherland is angry he'writes about "" addled eggs •' to your contemporary. Tarions uncivilised peoples of the earth delight in unsavory dishes. The Esquimaux delights in rancid blubber, etc, and Mr Dun can Sutherland, when vexed by ; rebellious ratepayers, resorts to "" addled eggs."" There is no accounting for tastes., Having presumably satisfied., himself with these unsavory articles, Mr Sutherland wanders away promiscuously from his "" addled eggs,"" arid brings up -against such things as the Counties Act and the Rabbit Act, which he informs the public are very intricate —interesting in formation, no 'doubt, and enables the public to correctly appraise Mr Suther landb mental ability. Brit should he seek to ijatige other-people's' anjHty by his own Homed comprehension ? T?hese things, which appear intricate to Mr Duncan Sutherland, are quite within the scope of any average mental grasp. I hope Mr Sutherland has not partaken too largely of his favorite dish, and become mentally addled himself in consequence. Mr Sutherland appears to find some affinity in his own mind between county rates"" and "" addled, eggs."" .All this, sir, arises from my having dared to. read cer tain penal clauses of the Counties Act at a-ratepayers' meeting, and a dozempeople could inform'-'Mr Sutherland that, theiull clause wis read; exceptions ana all. 3?bafc the 1 report of the meeting is a very bad or&is notmy fa'ult. But the real cahse of Mr Sfitherlarid's ariger isthe 'ratepayers meet at all to discuss this matter of county rates —a most audacious thing for them to do. Now, sir, I would suggest to Mr Suther land that, in place of descending to such; buffoonery as writing about his '.'addled ezgs,'"" he look upon the Otekaike rate payers as mature minded men, having a purpose in, view, and who are, not to be waived' aside j and men also wtio object to Deing rated when no rates are required Let Mr Sutherland explain, then, or try to, why he sanctions the collection of further rates from the; Otekaike ratepayers when he has, by his own showing, enough money on hand and accruing to carry .on for at least two years to come, at the 'average rate'of expendi ture taken over .several years past. He carefully avoids . explaining that. t Mr Sutherland is said to pay nbt a penny of county rates from his owff pocket, so"" does not feel the pinch of unnecessary rates in hard times. If _he paid rates himself, he would be more cautious"" about the exercise of his rating power. But Mr Sutherland is only a kind 6f a dummy ratepayer, who pays rates with other people's money. Again, it is stated, on Mr Porter's authority, that the sum of LIOOO, which the Council has, or had, on deposit in the I bank, belongs to the Otekaike riding, j The interest earned by thi_s.deposit.is not placed to the credit of the Otekaike riding, but is credited to the general account;; Will Mr Sritherlarid explain the morality. or fairness of that proceeding. Further, a simple analysis of the county balancesheet shows that nearly L 22 gets absorbed by administration for,.every LIOO which reaches the roads. Will Mr Duncan Sutherland compare this with the cost of administration in other counties, and see how it works out. Not for his own benefit perhaps, as he is said to pay; no county rates himself, but for the benefit of the ratepayers who do pay rates. These things, sir, would be of more interest to the ratepayers than any, even the most learned, dissertation upon ""addled eggs."" While haying no wish to be at cross purposes with Mr Duncan Sutherland, he may rest fully assured that both myself and other ratepayers will continue to take the liberty of meeting together just when we please, and of looking into the state of our public business when we think fit, caring nothing for him or his anger.—l am, etc. A. H. Chapman. Kurow, November 6, 1896. TO THE EDITOR, A ratepayer who was present has sent you further information re meeting at Kurow. He points out that Mr Chapman informed the meeting that the administra: tive charges were L1909, and that only L 227 went to the roads. But Mr Chap man forgot to tell us that besides this L 227, the County carried on work through the whole of the ridings to the amount of L 4463 4s 3d. There, take the L1909, deduct charitable aid L 572, and roads and bridges L 227, and it leaves about L9lO administrative charges to 1 about L 4690 of work done, and not L 22 of work to LIOO of charges, as Mr Chap man stated. Then Mr Chapman got out balance at the following rate:— Balance 31st March ... £684 13 5 Balance Land Fund ... 849 2 7 Rate for 1896 and 1897 ... 546 911 Land Fund 1896 97 ... 576 17 11 Total £2657 3 10 And as we only expended L 723 8s 5d daring the year, Mr Chapman considered that we had no need to pay a'hy rate for three years. But Mr Chapman forgot to tell us that before this year's rate of L 546 9s lid and this year's Land Fnnd of L 576 17s lid are paid into the County Fund, we have had another year's ex penses in forming and repairing roads. Mr Chapman had no right to include the Land Fund whatsoever. We have L 849 2s 7d of Land Fund, but that does not all belong to the Otekaike riding, and even if it did, it can only be spent on specified purposes. Our real balance of rateable money was, on 31st March, 1895, L 590 Is 4d. Oa the 31sfc March, 1896, the balance stood at L 684 13s sd, so we only gained daring the year a sum of L 94 12s Id, and the work done during the year only amounted to L 723 8s sd, when the year before Lll'tiO was spent, and over LISOO for the year 1093-94. Surely, Mr Editor, no sane member for the Otekaike riding would let the fund of the riding go down to nothing. Where would he get the needful to do the work if a flood should come, when perhaps LSOO or L6OO is required all at once to make the road fit for traffic. It is a well-known fact that the Otekaike riding suffers more from flood than any other riding in the Waitaki County. It is correct that a motion moved by Mr Chapman was carried by one that the new member approach the Council to get the rate for this year re duced to one farthing; but if the new member does move it at the next County meeting, I can assure Mr Chapman and his eight supporters that it will only raise a sm.i!e at the meeting.—l am, etc. A Ratepayer.",1,0.236970929,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/oamaru-mail/1896/11/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The depu tation, in urging the council to assist, pointed out tbab there was a considerable number more of unemployed in town- than was dreamed' of. The council unanimously agreed to vote £500 towards the objfeb.

At a meeting of subscriber to the unemployed relief fund it was decided to &sk fch^ City Council to give permission for the cosisfto tion of a recreation ground on the hills 1 ebiud Wel lington terrace, and for wliiih work there is available at present about £2500.

We have not detmed ib necessary to join in these, though we oouldnofe help deploringthe very doubtful taste displayed by the conductors of the journal. But an official publication like this should be above publishing reports concerning tha local labour market which can only be termed misleading.

327,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,14,OHINEMURI.,"(fbom A COBBE3PONDENT.) Waitekaubi, July 10, I visited tho Waitekauri Company's bat tery yesterday, and find things in a pretty forward state; still I think it will take fully a month yet before they oro ready to mako a start. The water-wheel, a ponderous piece of machinery, is not yet finished j the arms of tho wheel are all in their placo but tho buckots aro not yet attached, though thoy are dressod and ready. When complotod it will probably bo tho finest and most powerful wheel in Now Zcalaud. In tho battory tho stam pers are all in their place, and tho tables aro nearly finished, but thero is some gearing yet to connect. Tho tables avo well set with good lengths of blanket streaks, and everything to all appoarance constructod.with a view to efficiency and j economy of labour. There is storago in I tho battory for four or five hundred tons of quartz. Tho whole construction re flects groat credit on Mr Corbott, tho designer aud contractor. Tho tramway from tho battory to tho mino is complotod, and I am told works satisfactorily. Tho trucks carry only a ton of quartz, but I think this is a mistake, as it would bo quito as easy to work trucks currying 30 owt,, which would sond far more stuff to tho battery in tho samo time At tho mino tho hoppor is finished, and tho mauagor is now constructing tho tram way over it, which is a heavy pioce of work, necessitating somo very long tresties. Tho timber suited for this work is difficult fo obtain and requires a great deal of labour. Above the hopper a platform will be constructed with a crane for hoisting timber on the tramway from the platform were it will be dressed. This will be a great a good deal of the timber necessary for the mine will have to be brought up from the neigh bourhood of the battery. The manager is putting in very strong sets of timber in the main level, and is pushing all the works forward in order to be fully pre pared by the timo the battery is ready to start. The Homeward Bound,apieceof ground adjoining tho Waitekuribouadary,isabout to start work, and I think it will be likely to turn out well, as it lies in a direct lino with the find of gold which recently took place in the Waitekauri. In ttio Welcome tho reef is looking much better and prospects well. Tho manager is laying down tramway, and constructing a paddock for the quarlz. Ho has already erected a forge for the use of the mine, and is having a house built to reside in, but ho is disgusted with the slow progross the sawyers aro making, and tho sawyers on the other hand aro dis gusted with the hardness and bad quality of tho timber, and though working from daylight till dark can scarcely make it pay. Tho long looked-for heavy stamper box for Wieks's battery has arrived at last. It passed tho Forgus and Shannon olaim about four o'clock on Saturday. There* wore ten bullocks and two horses engaged in conveying it, and they seemed quite done up; poor brutes, I pitied them, the sad plight they were in; and from tho very bad state of ""tho roads men engaged in drawing them were nearly as bad; how ever, tho greatest obstacle has at last been overcame, and I think Wieks's battery will probably bo tho first to start crush ing in tho Waitekauri district. There is great credit due to Mr Wick's for his in domitable perseverance in pushing the construction of this battery under the difficulties ho has had to contend with, and it is to bo hoped that it will pay him well for his courage and euergy. We have had a visit horo from Mr Yesey Stewart and a number of the Kati kati settlers, some of whom expressed great wonder at tho works of the Waite kauri mine, while others, in walking over some quartz, congratulated themselves on having at last walked on a pavement of gold. I think it is now timo that tho post master made somo arrangement for a postal service to this place, as letters and papers can now only be sent by hand, and there is great irregularity in the de livery. There is a pretty large population hero at present, and they are daily in creasing, and I think they are entitled to a postal service as well or. better than Tairua or other places with much smaller populations than this.",1,0.185527163,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/thames-advertiser/1876/07/15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,182,The Nature of the Game of Chess.,"The following is taken from a little work lvtely published at R.iga, by A«.charin, the celebrated Livonian master :— It is the enrrentr opinion that chess demands mathematical aptitudes, and since in that science everything is brought out by calculation, this should be the most important faculty of the chess player. The good people who reason in thia way imagine a game of chess to be simply a problem to be solved : the pieces and squares are the known quantities ; state your equation, and deduce from it the value of the unknown quantities ! But are the adversary's move 3 also known quantities capable of being taken Into account in the equa tion? No; they are contingencies defying all calculation —all intervention of algebraic order. At the beginning of a game eaah payer ha=t 20 moves at his disposal. If P-K 4 is chosen as the first move, Black and White have then the choice among 28 moves. As the game proceeds the num ber of possible move 3 increases at a terrible rate, since every oue of those moves in relation to the adversary's reply opens a new perspective. We make, however, at once one necessary conces sion—that is, that a Rimple examination at once enables the expsrieucea amateur definitely to eliminate as being bad tho greater part of the poß*ible moves; but even then the field opsn for anjlysis remains none the les3 without bounds, and tha term of one life would not suffice to get through one single Kama, to examine all the lines of play and to exhaust all the variations with their ramifications. It is easily seen, therefore, that for chess a mathematical organitation is an insufficient auxiliary— the game demands above all things another gift, that of being able, while going on with the combination, of repre sent r ng by tho imagination in something like a material form the position which changes with every move. Tbis gift, in my opinion, is of the very greatest importance, since it is that which makes the analysis of a position prove easy — in fact actually possible. Then cornea the memory, by means of which our knowledge and experience i 3 enabled to profit by the lessons of theory and practice. Then qujeknets of perception is another important faculty, in addition to coolness in weigh ing carefully the eventualities, and energy to take at once . the propar course. Beyond those, which constitute tho mastery of the_ game, there is f-till genius— that misteriou* bird, the nature of which we cannot explain, but which we recognise by the rustling of its wings. The mere calculator encounters an impassable boundary which gcuius clears at one bound, and what it discovers spontaneously demands from others efforts evdn to uuelerstanrt. Leibnitz said that chess was too much of a came for a science, and too much of a science for a game. However flattering this compart-on may be to chess I compare it rather to an art, if such a comparison be admissible. Like art, chess is want ing in that immediate and humanly practical utility affo'ded by science. Again, like Art, it elevates and i oothee our minds and at the same time affords us a noble relaxation from the trivial necessities of our existence. If Art revrals tj U3 th • beautiful, ch?s* also is aMe to do so. It repays in some way, aecordiug to the point of vtew from which we regard it. If we look upon it as a problem for calculation, the result obtained will be as arid as the method chosen. The real adept demands fiom chess a more elevated enjoyment — that ia to say, the ple«suie which attends the exercise cf iutellectual forces and the reciprocal contest of idea3.""— La Strategic, May 1895.

318,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,5,"THE Thames Advertiser SATURDAY, JULY 15, 1876.","We published in our yesterday's issue clause 40 of the proposed Local Eating Bill, and to section 5 of that clause we shall refer. It is by no means a rule that exceptional legislation is produc tive of good to that branch of the com munity for whose benefit it is intended; or for the interests of the country gene rally. In this. colony, however, where the European population have estab lished large towns, and have acquired a large territory, some portions of which were acquired by conquest, they are more or less intimately associated with an aboriginal race who not only have shown themselves capable of opposing a formidable force to the British arms, but the most powerful and numerous sections under the authority of a king still continue to hold the law at defiance,.and compel the Government to respect the attitude they have assumed. They have also, ,by their intelligence, been considered worthy to return their representatives to the House of Assembly, and no cir cumstance has arisen in which. they have not deported themselves with dignity in the senate. This, in a few words, is the position of the two.races, and until time or events effect a change the natives will continue to demand concessions, and the policy of the Go vernment, influenced by the Native Department, will be to grant them. The section of clause 40, to which we have referred, is an instance. It is proposed to exempt property in native occupation from the operation of this Act, and the question we shall briefly discuss is the expediency of this exemp tion. The natives, with their natural shrewdness, observed that when a road was constructed by their permission through lands in their occupation (being within a highway district) that such property was chargeable with a rate, and they could not see the force of granting land for roads and then to be taxed. They also argue that if they allow a road to be continued the Highway district.will be immediately extended, and this reason they advance in support of their objec tion. Thus Eewai has stoutly resisted the cutting through the hill at Parawai \mtil a promise was exacted from the Superintendent to forego the obnoxious road rates, not only for himself, but for all the natives. In order to show the Government this was their most serious objection to allow a road through their lands, their member, Mr Nahe, drew up a petition to that effect, which was. signed by fifty of the Maoris, and only eight of the old fathers of the tribe refused to sign. This maybe consi dered but a feeble expression of their opinion when the influence of a single chief is sufficient to obstruct any in tended line of road ; but small as it is, it will, if properly handled, do much to break' down their prejudice and facili tate the establishment of 'the''highway. comm\inication so much' needed between the Borough of Thames and Ohinemuri. The natives are sensible of the advantages of a good road and the value it gives their lands, notwith standing all they assert to the contrary. Many of them regard with a pardon able jealousy the easy lives and large incomes of those of their countrymen who only ten years ago lived in a hut and rejoiced in a blanket; they are as alive to the advantages of fortune, and to the position' it confers, as any Euro pean in the land, and they also know that a road which costs them nothing is a necessary means ito that end. .We cannot argue the principle of fairness in this exemption from rates which any European would be obliged to pay, and nothing but the desire to see the coun try opened and our goldfields connected would induce us to support this excep tional act of legislation.",1,0.15796614,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/thames-advertiser/1876/07/15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,6,BLUB SPUR.,"(From our own correspondent.) ■ January 11th, 1870. Yesterday evening was the time appointed for the annual educational meeting. At the time appointed there was scarcely a sufficient number present to warrant the proceedings being commenced ; were it not that the law make it imperative there would have been an adjournment. Mr E. M. Manuel, the Chairman of the late Committee, occupied the chair, who briefly opened the business of the evening, and called upon the teacher to read the report, from which we gathered that there were upwards of 50 children in atten dance at the school, 31 of whom use the slate and write f ro^i copy, 9 write and dictate their ow n letters. The report stated that an extra room was urgent, where the sewing mistress can retire with her class for that part of instruc tion. It is hoped that the committee about t«> be elected would set about this wi.rk at once, as it could not be delayed without detriment to the interests of the school. Mr Lange moved that the report be re ceived, and took occaaiou to remark that the teachers deserved every encouragement ana sympathy. That it was due to Mr M'Lelland to say that he labored diligently and effi ciently, and he hoped to see that he pos sessed the conßdence and the warm sympathy of the parents. He (Mr Lange) could truly say of Mr MLelUnd that he was as 9 fathe to the children, and he thought it a very fortunate thing for the district to secure the services of such a teacher. Seconded by Mr Alexander Corraack, and carried unanimously. The Chairman then called upon sax a. js. Mathews, the •ecretaryi to rend th« financial statement. Mr Mathews uid that the mos; aatiifactoiy part of his duty was to amiounc that they had a balance in hand, after meet ing all expenses, of 9s 6d ; this, of course embraced the collection of the outstanding fees, amounting to over LlO. . Mr A. S. Thomson asked why there was so much outstanding 1 The teacher repli«d, that last year, befor. the school opened, he got in every .sixpence, and had no doubt that he would re-open thi year also with a ''clean sheet."" He (th teacher) bore testimony to the regulant. with which the parents paid the fees. Th explanation was satisfactory, and the fiuau cial part of the proceedings was passed witj. a well-merited eulogium to Mr Jtfathewi to. the great labor, and the deep interest he had taken in the school since its commencement. Before the Comiuittee retire! « Vote of thanks was accorded to then for their ••<•» vices during the past yea*. Mr Manaol briefly replied. The folio aring geitlemen were then elected for the ensuing year :— • Messrs Lange, J. Cormnck, T. F, Morris, E, Varcoe E fti. Manuel, A. B. M^iiewa, M, Rotfttrhan, R.

84,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,11,THE WEATHER IN THE MACKENZIE COUNTYY.,"Mr John S. Rutherford paid a visit to his Mistake station last week (says the Lyttelton Times), leaving home on Saturday and return ing to Timatu on Thursday night. He brought down the horses (11) and cattle (12; from the station. The cattle and horses had been six weeks in the snow, bat they must have been able to get food, or they would not be in such condition as they were, or be able to make the journey down as they did in two days, with nothing to eat on the way. The fact is, cattle and horses work hard and paw away the mow until they get at the grass. Sheep will paw away the snow where the tip of a tussock shows, but the bigger stock work away ""at a face,"" and shift the snow over large patches. Coming down, of .course, they had no lime to get feed in that way. The net result of the winter, Mr Rutherford believes, will be that not a sheep will survive ; those that live till the snow goes will die off when the feed comes again. But very few can survive the snow, as it must take a long time to disappear, there is such a depth of it. There is really no hope for any of them. The men on the stations are skinning what they can, bnt the skins cannot always be packed away, and if left lying they shrivel up and become almost worthless. If a thaw comes suddenly the skinning would soon be put a stop to by de- composition. As for the sheep, they are mere skin and bone, and one of the difficulties of station life just now is lack of meat. At The Mistake a beast had been killed and was hung up and frozen hard. When the cook wanted stakes he had to saw them off. Where mutton was depended on there is none to be had. The sheep are so waited that one pan lift them by the back like a kitten. There is tome talk of getting up a petition praying for remission of the sheep ra f e now due, aud also the current half year's rcuts, aud it is suggested that the Government should send some capable person to see the Mackenzie country in its present condition, and later, to report from a disinterested standpoint on the disaster. At present it would be difficult to get a petition signed, and unsatisfactory too, as there is a lack of definite information as to the extent of the losses. News was brought by the mailman that Mr Saunders, of The Wolds, is saving a number of his sheep by the use of the snow plough, with which he has made tracks into swampy places where there is a good deal of rough herbage. It appears that the sheep will scratch away the enow if they find anything to start on.",1,0.114809657,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 13 years' employment, he left the employ of Stewart and Co., and when they sued for payment for their account he pleaded the Tiuck Act, and now brought an action for the amount deducted from his wages with his con sent, though he had the uee of the proceeds.

There is doubtless more or lets risk m this practice, but when it fa tan* sidered that only new stamp* undergo this pro* ces«, I think the risk may be considered very small indeed.

About a month ago I was looking through an album in a London shop, when my attention was called toa rather faded blue stamp, the name and imprint of which was obliterated by the ordinary post office clerk's stamp. Something in the corner, however, caught my eye, and I aiked the dealer how much he wanted for it ? "" Oh 1 * he said, "" you can have that for Is. It is a very good old English ! "" I bought it, and have since sold it for £12, It was an old blue Hawaiian."" * . • •' Cba?ley "" (writing to a philatelic publi cation) says he has noticed that we always stand up for that most respectable institution, the post office, and we admit the soft impeachment). We have, perhaps, with big competitions, and in other ways; given the post office people as much trouble as anybody, and it is only right we should stand up for them when attacked. In this case, "" Charley "" sends the account of a postage stamp, which reached its destination having the address and the communication on its diminutive back. This ia nob at all a novelty; but we may point oat that it is a rather dangerous way of sending a communication, as the stamps are very likely to slip away and be lest; and v if this method were largely adopted, which it is not likely to be, some) rule would have to be made against it.

Every one has been to see Mis. .Thompson's now pictures "",0 uatjpe Rraf."" The sensation dinned by iiei' picture of the •' Roll Call"" will still be in your memory. Even Mr. Ruskin, that indiscriminate slaughterer of everything ■ •"""".Ciind 111 art Was comp etel} 7 overcome by i it when he approached it for the first time, , and pronounced upon it a stirring eu'ogy. Tt i 3 certainly a most remarkable painting. The picture represents a regiment of British , Infantry defending a position against French ; Artillery and Cavalry during the hard fight ing of Quatre Bras. The regiment has made ' a stand in the middle of a field of standing rye which has been trampled down by the repeated traversing of troops. In the centre of the painting is the band of devoted men. There they stand, grim old warriors, with the wrinkles of former campaigns, holding their muskets in a grip of iron and watching for a chance to pot a Frenchman ; andlthere too are recruits out for the fir.t time, who have got over the first flurry, and drunk with excitement are ready to leap out of the ranks and lay about them with the butt ends of their weapons, but are restrained by discipline. In a conspicuous place is a poor fellow hard hit, who even whilst death's seal is on his fac« stands in his place constant to the last, whilst a horse, riderless, which has lost its master in the last charge is leaping up iuto the air in the agonies of death from » volley of bullets. The brokeu and irregular square has evidently suff.red terribly from the fire of the French Artillery, but the gallant remnant stand, as British soldiers ever stood in the hour of peril, nor show a sign of flinching. The chief surprise about this picture is that, it should hive been conceived and painted by a female head and hand. It would have been a fine work coming from any easel, but how a woman could have imagined such ex- V quisitely nervous and realistic work connec ted with a field of blood and fire is a nine day's wonder. Miss 1 hompson is now engaged in depicting the return of the remnant of the "" Six Hundred "" from Balak lava charge, and we are all expecting wonderful results from her palette. MUNIFICENT DONATIONS FOR MIS SIONARY WOBKS. I am not sure if I said anything last mail about Stanley and his Afiican explorations. He wrote a long account of his discovery near the Victoria Kyanj.l ri a powerful and partially civilised native chief named Mtesa, who expressed himself very anxious to have teachers sent hjm, and to be instructed in Christianity and the arts. The consequence of Stanley's account of this pleasant native is that two anonymous people came forward and offered £5,01)0 a piece to the Church Missionary Society to send out a mission party to tbe country of this same Mtesa, so that after all Stanley is doing the work of a regular thoroughbred missionary. Stanley's geographical discoveries confirm those of Speke and Grant in 1860 in a remarkable manner. There is no doubt now that the Victoria Nyanzi is avast inland sea, and not a network of lngoons as was supposed, and that it is supplied from the northern slopes of the watershed crossed by Stanley in his journey from Zanzibar. It is more than pro bable that tbe source of tbe Nile is to be found in the Victoria Nyanza, but there is still some uncertainity about it. Then there is still the question as to the connection be tween the Victoria and the Albert Nyanzas and as to the source of the Albert Nyanza, which is said by some to be supplied from the ""Unknown Lake,"" of which Livingstone beard at Nyangwe in 1871. Possibly Lieut. Cameron may bring us some information which may enlighten us on these points, and in the meantime should Stanley's health be preserved, he has an immense work before him It has come out at last that after all Stanley is no American. Neither is his name Stanley, but Rowlands. He is a Welshman, hailing from Denbigh, and assumed the name of Stanley when he went to America years ago. In ISGS 6he served in the American Navy, and in 1860 came over to visit his mother, who is still alive. His Buccess in Africa so charmed the Americans that he did not care to let out that he was a Britisher. So in England he has been playing in the Tole of a Yankee, but in Wales he speaks his native Welsh. EXPECTED OUTBREAK IN INDIA. From time to time during the visit of the Prince of Wales to India there have been rumours of an unpleasant kind circulating with regard to the war in the E.st, bud ifc is qui.e certain that the Government do not give any weigh* to them. Nevertheless a general feeling seems to be gaining ground in India itself that we are on the eve of troubles in that country. This trouble, if it comes, will not arise from the people of the country itself, and nothing could be more loyally demonstrative than the conduct of the popu lace during the royal progress through all the large centres of civilisation. Still we have now some bother in the direction of the Srraits Settlements, and certain regiments have been ordered to Penang. The move ments of Russia are certainly suspicious, and although they may mean nothing it is im possible to get at the real truth of what is going on in tbe way of military movements in Central Asia. It is quite on the cards that the mimic campaign before the walls of D.lhi may eventuate in something more serious than a mere militrry pageant. THE MARQUIS OF NOEM-.NBY'S OPI NION OF NEW ZEALAND. Some letters have arrived in England, from the southern end of your colony, complaining of the scarcity of work, and complaining of the indiscriminate introduction of Govern ment immigrants. I know that cries of that kind are easily raised, an. none of the New Zealand papers say anything about distress— quite the contrary. The other day, speaking at m Meihodist Missionary Society's meeting, a Mr Leeman, M P for the city of York, sated that; he had received a letter from the Governor of New Zea and, a Yorkshire man, who in giving an interesting account of the. state of things in that colony, said there was no part in the world where wages were so high, and wherejjthe general prosperity was so marked.",0,-0.09544043,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/auckland-star/1876/02/17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,156,NOTES BY FORWARD.,"* . ' The Junior Flag matches on the coming Saturday are the last in ihe preliminary round. Upon the Taieri-University Second, the Ware housemen-Port Chalmers, and the Pirates Second- Alham bra Second matches depends the question as to which two of the Taieri, University Second, Pirates Second, and Port Gbalmers teams are, with the Green Island and Warehousemen, to be iu.,the seini-nual round. The following shows the result; of the competition to date : — -' The West Taieri played one match, which it lost Jby 11 points to nothing. * Won, one match by default ; t won three matches by default; § lost one match by de fault ; I! lost two matches by default. '. ' There should be some interesting junior feotball in Dunedin this month. A team from Christ College to play* the annual match' against the High School will be accom panied by a team from Wangacui College. The latter team play the High School, and in addition the match between the Christ College team and Wanganui Colirge is also expected to he played here. Further, there is a prospect of a Christchurch High School team coming down to piny a match, with the Otago High School. • . • A Wangacui representative team left for Auckland on Tuesday, and play there on Saturday next. The following compose the team : — Qresswell (captaiu), Tilly, D. Blair, M'Lean, Johnston, Thomson, Craig, Gray, R. M'Lean, Emmerson, Riddell, J. B. Blair, Conuell, Grogan, Morton. * . • In the match at Wellington on Saturday between Wellington College and St. Patrick's College the former won by 18 points to nothing. It was generally admitted that it was one of the beat matches Eeen this season. The following are supplied tome as being the records of clubs not in the union : — * . ' AWellington telegram states that the New Zealand Union is issuing a further instalment of case law embodying recent decisions. It includes the following -. — A- try is scored where the ball was first touched dead. A fair catch muit be a clean catch at the first attempt, and a mark must be made. When a ball is in a scrummage every player, except those in the scrummage, must stand on bis own side of a line drawn through the centre of a scrum at right angles to the touch line, or must be adjudged off-side, and any player outside a scrum kick ing or putting the ball back into a serum after it has come out, places his forwards off-side. ' . ' Why the Appeal Committee of the New Zealand Union should have puzzled their brains to decide the spot where a try is scored, as stated iv the'foregeing paragraph, and why the New Zealand Union should take the trouble to issue that decision in its further instalment of case law is not at all clear, seeing that the English Rugby Union, which is the 'highest judicial authority on the laws of football, .has already decided that a try is secured at the spot where it is first touched down, and that this ruling is to be found in all the annuals published in this colony, including that (if it is to be. dignified by the name of ""annual"") issued by' the New Zealand Union. • . • With the ruling of the New Zealand Union that a player, outside a scrummage, is of an imaginary line drawn through the off-side, if he does not stand on his own side centre of a scrum at right angles to the touch line I cannot at all agree. So long as a player keeps behind the ball he is, as the laws of the game are at present, not off-side, and it seems to me absurd to suggest that he is to stand passively outside the scrum on his own side and watch an oppo nent make, off with the ball. It is almost equivalent, as a prominent .footballer put it to me, to placing the ball in the hands of a half back, whose forwards have secured the ball in the scrum, and telling him to show what he can do with it. * . * The laws as to off-side play may at pre sent be imperfeot— l do not for a moment con tend that they are not — and it is no doubt a regrettable feature in the game that backs should get on their opponents' side of the scrum, but it is not illegal, and no decision of the New Zealand Union's Appeal Committee can make it illegal. I do not know whether this ruling is-to be regarded as in - force in the colony, but if it is I would advise players that they need not regard it, for any decision by a referee under it would be promptly reversed by the supreme authority. It is a frequent practice in England for backs to get on tbeir opponents' side of the scrum, and the practice was last year retorted to without let or hindrance in the greatest match of tho year — that between England and Scotland. I do not defend the practice, for it is contrary t < the spirit of the game, but I do maintain that it is not illegal. %~f I have, since writing the above, observed with satisfaction il|^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H the Wellington RngS^Q^^^^^^^^^^H evening, a resolution . wns^^^^^^^^^^^f against the decision of thVNew^QH^^^H Appeal Committeo in refefarlce toscrunfiHMH as being opposed to the rules laid down bylSl English Union, and as being not an interpret*] tiou, but a new rule. They urged that the ooia-l mittee in passing it have exceeded their duty, and that it would be manifestly unfair to bring it into force bo late in the season. The union Asked that the decision be reconsidered. ; . "" As a general rule referees have not, I think, much reason to oomplain of the treat ment they receive from the spectators at matches. Where a referee exhibits an accurate knowledge oF the laws of the game, is slrictly impartial, and controh tho play with firmness it will be generally found that he receives tha cordial praises of the public, who. it mast be remembered, are not ignorant critics. On the North ground, however, it is that the referees at the la9t two Senior Fla» matches were grossly iu.-ultod by spectators— chiefly, I.believe, by Fnull buys. It is exceed ingly to be regretted that this should have been the case, and it is lamentable to record that a referee after officiating on that groucd a couple of Saturdays back had to seek the .protection of a member of the police force in order to escape tha pressing attentions of a number of: hoodlums who were not wholly satisfied with his decisions. Under these circumstances the committee of the Referees' Association Jast week passed the following .resolution :—"": — "" That no referee be sent to the North ground until an aMurance is given by the Uuion' Clab that he will be proteoted from iusulfc from, the spec tators."" ' . '1 am not satisfied that the Referees' Asso ciation in pasting this resolution have pursued the course which it should have adopted. There oan be no question that the association is acting quife within its rights in refusing to supply a referee for a certain grouud— it . has done so before, and with admirable results — but that re fusal involves a puuishment of the innocent with the guilty, for it means that teams visiting the Norlh ground have, in common with the home ttams, to be content to accept whoever they may find willing to act for them, and after their experience of the working of the Referee*' Association moat teams must regard that as a distinct hardship. Tho appropriate punishment, it seems to me, 6f the conduct ofthe spectators at the Norlhground would be the disqualifica tion of the ground itself. That punishment would have to be inflicted by the Rugby Union. For such a line Of conduct, moreover, there is authority, grounds having been suspended in England on account of lusult'ug conduct to wa ds referees. ' . ' There is less cause for dissatisfaction with the O.R.F.U. Match Committee 's solection of trial teams for the coming Saturday than there was with thoso picked tor last Saturday. The prinoiple upon which such forwards as the~ Wilkinson brothers and Campbell were omitted from last Saturday's teams while players who have served tbeir clubs during tha year as half backs were iiAludsd among the forwards was certainly rather puzzling. There is not so much fault, in my judgment, to be found with next Saturday's teams. Players are included in them whom I should have replaced by others, but I do not venture to set up my opinion against the opinions of the gentlemen compos ing the Match Committee, and so I do nob indi vidualise. It is certaiD that a strong team can be got, and I doubt not that tho Match Com mittee will make a good selection. • . • The Management Committee of the New Zealand Union m£t on Jdly 30 to consider the question of the North v. South ItUnd match Atter disoussion it was found that, owing to the great number of inter-union matches to be played th-s year and the position of the teams, it would bo impossible to play the match in Wellington before about the 21st September ; but it was considered that as both Wellington and Auckland teams would be ia Canterbury about the time, and the Taranaki men would be coming down as far as Wellington, the match might be played at Cnristchurch on Thursday, August 22, provided tho unions were 'agreeable. It was decided to communi cate at once with the unions to see whether this could be arranged and whether Laucagtei Park would be available, and to hold a furthex meeting on Wednesday, August 7, to whioh the nnions would be-a*ked to send their views, and also their views-as to the best means of select ing the teams. Playing the m*tch in Christ church on that date, it was considered, would greatly reduce .the cxpeme. It was decided to ask the unions to find the expenses of sending their men to Christ church, the gate to be devoted to return ing these and other expenses in connection with' the match. It was decided to forward to the unions the recommendation of the Wel lington Referees' Afscct&tioa tbat tha English Union be asked to amend the law so 'as to pro vide that a free kick be grarited for wilfully ""throwing the ball forward. The C*nterbury ■Rugby Union has wired to the New Zealand Union that the 22nd August will be a con venient date for the North v. South football rn*tch, and that Lancaster Park h»a been secured For that day. • . ' 'The match under Association rules be tween the Ro9lyn and fUngejs Clubs excited much interest last Saturday last. The com bination throughout was excellent, but despite ' this fact individual play calls for a fair amouns of comment. Of the Roslyn backs, Ellis in goal was decidedly the ""weak spot, his fisting out being feeble and his tactics generally suffer ing in comparison with those of the opposing goal custodian. The play of G. M'-Millan, Calder, and Hayward was of a very high order of Merit, their kicking and tackling boing especially good. D. M'Millau, however, scarcely seemed up to his usual form, but whether this was due to the determined tackling of Sligo it is hard to say. Certainly his kicking was not so powerful or at times well judged as it generally is, a result which may perhaps be attributed to the .fact that he was promptly tackled whenever the ball approached his vicinity. Bunting played very consistently. Of the forwards, J. M'Millan worked hardest and with most effect, his heading and fo'lovring up gaining considerable advantage for his side. P. M'Millan, Dobson, and Brown also passed and dribbled with marked skill ; while Watgon, more especially in the first spell, seemed decidedly ""off colour."" For the Rangers, Kober, in goal, rendered valuable ttrvice, several times saving his side by well-judged fisting out. The first score against the Rangers was almost entirely due to the misadventure of his slipping. At the commencement of the game both Ashton and O'Connor playe'd steadily, but improved as the afternoon wore on, and in the second spell ware playing in their bett form. Of the haKes, M'Laughlan was most prominent, his tricky play several times non plussing the Roslyn players, though at times he was apt to indulge his powers in this direction to too great an extent. A. North and Hilgen dorf were very safe — the former with his kick ing, the latter in taokling. ' The forwards throughout played an even game, and in the second ipell fairly surpassed themtelves. Adams showed most improvement, and if he, continues to play up to Saturday's form will ba one of the most dangerous wing - forward* fa» into goal, ; while to left wing, the foore must be attributed, together most unselfishly, passing into the centre was very Hraective. - ■""""*.• There i* no doubt that had tbe referee Bnn' th« Morninjjtor.-Q'jeen's Park match been in a position to sco it, another goal would have been given to Mornington, as after the match several Park men admitted that the ball had gone between the pests. The game was played in a' very friendly spirit, but the excitement at the Rcsiyn-Rdugera match on several occasions took the attention of players away from their own match. Often the ball would come to a back, and he would be found looking intently across to the other ground. Gftftide and Holgate scored for Mornington. The Morn* jngton barks are very light, and tbe heavy ground did not suit them at all. The Queen's Park forwards all "" played well, and in NiC""lscn, Smeaton, Hayne*, Campbell, and Hamilton they have a good quintet. The backs also showed good form, one old Home players playing a very safe and sure game. Hacdonald, Robertson, and Rodgers also played well. Mr Little controlled the game to the entire satisfaction of both teams. • . • The captain of the Rosljn Club writes ask ing me to publish rule 2 of the game, showing thXt the referee in Saturday's game between the Rosljn and Rangers Clubs was in error in making the Roslyn forwards stand 10 yards from the ball, at the same time asserting that the forwards of the side whose privilege it is to kick off may stand wherever they choose, provided they keep behind the ball. The rale reads as follows: — ""The winters of the toss shall have the option of the kick ""ff or choice of goals. The g*rne shall be commenced by a pHce-kiek from the centre of the ground in the direction of the opposite goal line. The other side shall not approach within 10 yards of the ball until it is kicked off ; nor rhall any player on either side pass the centre of the ground in the direction of his opponents' goal until the ball is kicked off.""",0,-0.138441816,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

277,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,204,COOLGARDIE-WANT WATER.,"Perhaps few in Melbourne (says a writer in Melbourne Punch) know the meaning of the name Coolgardie — native words signifying want (cool) water (gardie). The place is well named, and it is said more time is lost "" out back "" in looking for water than gold. A returned Victorian tells me that for women there is plenty of work in typewriting a&d dressmaking. A costume cannot be made under 25 i or 30a, and ladies are being~con tinaally disappointed. There is a great deal of gaiety in Coolgardie. All the women (as would be the case on a desert island) try to dresa better than anyone elso. There is no opening for companions or any position like that, for nearly everyone lives in canvas houses and has no more room than is abso lutely necessary. AH are here to make money; no one is considered in any better position than others, no matter how they live. Women live in two -roomed canvas houses, and may ba seen dragging their own firewood, washing, &c. Women who in Mel bourne and England had housekeepers and whose life was a holiday find here what life really means. Young men who never knew what work was here endure toil that tries the strongest, out in the bush, perbap?, with one camel and a black boy for montns till the food gives oat, then forced into Ooolgardie, where they can only live on their former mates until another rush takes place, then off again fall of hope and high spirits. ""There is a lot of queer friendship on a gold field. A man can get any amount of drink— champagne at 25s a bottle— all night long, so long as he does not let his friends know he is down on his luck. Bat if he asks one of those friends for £5 to boy a suit of clothes they would laugh him off the field ; so that everyone who comeß in has of course a wonderful find ""some way out back."" Ragged and dirty clothes go for nothing. I knew of one young fellow, son of one of the best families in Balaclava, who came in after nine months out back in rags and his boots gone. He had walked many miles on the rough stones, and not a penny in his pocket. Yet he was in great spirits, and no one knew he was so down or so done. In three weeks he was off again with a prospecting party. They thought he was obliging them by going to show where the. gold was. Major Keogh, so many years a member of the Melbourne Club, is cooking for his son, who is working down a mine at Bayley'B. The son is only 19, was educated in England, and passed all his military examinations at Sandhurst. He joined his father at Albany, tramped from Southern Cross to Coolgardie — 115 miles — and set to work in the mine. Major Keogh was ill with fever for two months. We read sad tales of the tramp of convicts across the plains to the Russian Siberia, but I think Ooolgardie could tell some sadder ones of the tramp over those dreary miles between Southern Cross and Ooolgardie.

278,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,205,PARIS AT THE GRAND PRIX.,"Harper's Magazine has not been so inte resting for many months as it is in the June number. It is full of good articles. One of the best Is Mr Richard Harding Davis's paper on "" The Grand Prix de Pari3."" Mr Davis has the knack of writing very vividly, whether he is describing his own country, Paris, or England. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BACJB. The two most distinctive features of the Grand Prix, says Mr Davis, are the numbers of beautifully - dressed women who mix quietly with the men around the booths at which the mntuals are sold, and the fact that everyone speaks English, either because that is his native tongue, or because, if he be a Frenchman, he finds so many English terms in his racing vocabulary that it is easier for him to talk entirely in that tongue than to change from French to English three or four times in each sentence. "" Bat the most curious, and in a way the most interesting, feature of the Grand Prix day is the queer accompaniment to which the races are run. It never ceases or slackens or lowers its sharp monotone. It comes from the machines which stamp the tickets bought in the mutual pools. If yon can ima gine a hundred ticket collectors on an ele vated railroad station all chopping tickets at the same time, and continuing at this unin terruptedly for five hours, yea can obtain an idea of the sound of this accompaniment. It is not a qnection of canoslling a five- cent railroad ticket with these little Instruments. It is the same to them whether they dip for the girl who wagers a louis on the favourite for a place, and who stands to win two francs, or for the English plunger who has shoved 20,000fr under the wire, and who has only the little yellow and red ticket which ono of the machines has so nonchalantly punohed to show for bis money. Peoplo may neglect the horses for luncheon, or press over the rail to see them rush past, or gather to watch the President of tha Republic enter to a solemn fanfare of trumpets between lin«s of soldiers ; but there are always a few left to feed these little machines, and their clicking goes on through the 'whole of the hot, dusity day, like the clipping of Che ahears of Atropos."" ANGLOPHOBIA ON THE RACECOURSE : A SBRIOUS CHARGIS. The Grand Prix (tie continues) is the only race at which you are generally sure to win money. You can do this by simply hotting against the English horse. The English horse is generally the favourite, and of late years the French horseowners bavo been so loath to see the blue ribbon of the French turf go to perfidious Albion that their patriotism sometimes overpowers their love of fair play. # If the English horse is not only the favourite, but also happens to belong to the stable of Baron Hirscb, you hate a com bination that apparently can never win on French soil, and you c&n make your bets accordingly, When Matchbox walked on to the track last year he was escorted by eight gendarmes, seven detectives in plain clothes, hia two trainer?, and the jockey, and it was not until he was well out in the middle of the track that Ibis bodyguard deserted him. Possibly if they had been allowed to follow him reund the course on bicycles he might have won, and no combination of French, jockeys oouid have ridden him into the rails, or held Cannon back b£ a pressure of one knee in front of another, or driven him to making such excursions into unknowu terri tory to avoid these very things that the horse had little strength left for the finish. AFTER THE BACE. Some excellent pieces of description are given of the scenes on the evening of the race in the Jardin de Paris :— "" You will see on that night, and enly on that night, all of tbo most celebrated women of Paris racing with liuked arms about the asphalt pavement which circles around the bandstand. It is for them their one night of freedom in public, when they are per mitted to conduct themselves as do their less prosperous sisters, when, instead of reclining in a victoria in the Boie, with eyes demurely fixed ahead of them, they oan throw off re straint and mix with all the men of Paris, and show their diamonds and romp and dance and chaff and laugh as they did when they were not so famous. The French swells who are their escorts have cat down Ohinese lantorns with their sticks, and stuck the candles inside of them on the top of their high hats with the burning tallow, and made' living torches of themselves. So on they go, racing by — first a youth in evening drew, dripping with candle-grease c and then a beautiful girl in a dinner gown, with her silk and velvet opera cloak slipping from her shoulders — all ginging to the mueic of the band, sweeping the people before thvm, or closing in a circle round some stately digni tary, and waltzing furiously past him to pre vent his escape. Sometimes one party will storm the bandstand and seize the musicians' instruments, while another invades the atage of the little theatre, or overpowers the women in charge of the shooting gallery, or insti tutes a hurdle race over the iron tables and wicker chairs."" A PABIBIAN CHORUS/ But the climax of the night was reached last year, when the band of a hundred pieces shuck buoyantly into that most reckless and impudent of marches and comic song«, "" The Man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo."" The cymbals clashed and the big guns em phasised the high notes, and the brass blared out boastfully with a confidence and swagger that showed how sure the musicians were of pleasing that particular audience with that particular tune. And they were not dis appointed. The 3000 men and women hailed the first bars of the song with a. yell of recog nition, and then, dancing and strutting to the rhythm of the tune, and singing and shouting it in French and English, they raised their voices in suoh a chorus that they could be heard defiantly proclaiming who they were and what they had done as far as the boule vards^~And when they reached the high note in the chorue, the musicians, cartied away by the fever of the crowd, jumped upon the chairs, and held their instruments as high above their heads as they could without losing control of that high note, and everyone «tood on tiptoe, and many on one foot, all holding on to that highest note as long as thoix breath lasted.",0,-0.162290153,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,54,THE MINING INDUSTRY.,"•TO THE EDITOR. Sir, — ""Excelsior's"" letter cannot be refuted. Where, indeed, would be many of the well-to do coloDifts bad it not been for the goldfields and their concomitant requirements making the fortunes of many. It seems to be beginning to dawn on the people of New Zealand that they \ have as good things as either South Africa or Australia if the same capital and tkill were em ployed ; and it goes without snyiug that had £1,500,000 been borrowed to assist and promote the milling industry, a much wider benefit would have resulted than by assisting farmers and settlers. It is computed that three men can grow food for 100. How many thousand miners might this day be profitably employed if only once started. Is ib too late ? Bea what strides the West Coast is making under the regis of Mr Ziinan's important proposals, which it; is to be hoped the Government will full in with, and induce him to favour Otago with a visit, when eqnaUy as good things as exists on tho West Coast can be shown him. In the Financial News of Juue 13 last some 300 South African mining companies sbare3 are quoted the companies having capitals of from £250,000 downwards ; while only four New Zealand mines are quotad, as follows ; — Achilles, Hauraki, Waihi, Waihi Silver ton — or only one company in the Middle Island of New Zealand ! Is it any wonder we are ""not up to date""? — millions untouched be neath our feet. But re enterprise, those who have waxed tich mostly from the resultant volume of trade and consequent rise in v^lue of their properties sit idly by and withhold snp porting the indusbry which builb their for tunes, fearing to lose. Such hanging back in the collar was experienced when the Bell Cole man system of freezing mutton was fir«t intro duced, and two years were lost before Obago awoke and adopted it as Australia did. Let us now awake so far as the miniDg industry it con cerned, and follow in the footsteps of South Africa and Australia. To begin with, a sys tematic (if necessary, under Government in spection) series of boring partiee, properly equipped, should be set to wo>k, tenders being called for public competition. There are numerous rock drills now in use in the United States, Africa., and the colouies, and improve ments are daily being patened. See with what successful results these are attended in finding wat*r beads and quartzand other lodesat a mini mum < zpeuse, reducing mining to an almost cer taiuty, and thus doing away witb the necessity of sinking expan«iveshaft»ordriving extensive tun nels to ptove the existence of payable ore before erecting machinery, &c , as so often hafe been done in the past ou duffer mines. It ia no use going in for "" fiddling "" in miniDg— it is no loDger digging. See the large capital aud enormous sums given for claims in other ! colonies. Soon there would be no unem ployed in the land, bub a demand for the I labour of thousands, who would in return give employment to all trades from the farmer up, and prosperiby would once more revisit New Zealand. To assist these boring operations a sum should be placed ou the Estimates, the cost being a first charge to recoup the Government's original outlay. No doubt the requisite capital would be forthcoming to carry on the necessary mining operations once ifc was indubitably proved pay able ore was discovered.

The meeting now uuder notice was the inaugural of the Congress, and the' delegates met in Scots Church, Melbourne; 'Ihe evening station was devoted to a conference on gambling', with special leference to the proposal to bring a bill into i arliainent to legalise* the totaruittdr. According to the paper I have been reading, there was a good audience at thin meeting, which was open to the public, and included "" a fairrepro* senintiun of the lioi- £ c-raciug community."" In this s.ime report it says that "" by rtque&t a deputation of tin se [racing men] waited on lJr li<.vun in the moniiiiK, dim a friendly di-cus-sion ti.ok pluco in View of eulif tins his> sympathy with th« bill."" The diclor was hwkwardly snuattd. lib had feiven-it as bin iieisonal opin-on that he thought that. this bill mignt minimise the evil* of bettings but «3 the prcsi'ient of the ouncil he sat over a body which had dtcreed. to givo neither quarter not sauciioii to such a compromise. This must mean to him the tin king of thu individual to th« will of the whole. A» the evening session, the mbjeot was ably and cilmly introduced by Alt Eggl-tton, a solicitor, who gave an able review of the legal enactments iv reference to gambling. But these, said he, aa experience has again aud ugain shown, are too otlcn inoperative, or if operative; only against the little mail, \shile tho lig man gets iff scot free. He could see no distinction betwevn the totirii aat'jr and the roulette tablets of Monte Carlo. It might i-xcue the excrescences, do away with the noturimis blacklegs, but by making it more re spectable aud more. reliable w u!d teud to enlarge the area of gambling. Viewing ie as they did from the moral standpoint, and seeing in its bitter and disastrous eoru-equencc} the fruit- of the evil root from which it sprung, he could not sanction any system which mude terms with it. Af-er the introducer of the discussion came Mr Muritiy, M L.A., who had charge of tbe To.tali tator bill. Iv a moderate' Breech the- politician set forth the objects lie believed the measure wuukl cumpubs, combated some of the argument a of the lawyer, and epoke of the blow the bill would deal the bookmakers. Ho frankly recognised tbe "" dire curse this widespread gambling habit was to the community, but believed that it wuuld be minimised by such a machine as this. The chanties would be benefitei by the percentage that would be appropriated, and many of the woist evils would be effectually ex tinguished."" Or the several speakers -who followed, much attention waß centred in the remarks of the Bey. J.

329,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,16,POLICE COURT.-Yesterday.,"(Before \f. Eraser, Esq,, K.M.) DBUNKENNEsa.—Ale'xandor Bruce and Jessie Wingate were charged with having been drunk and incapable, the former in Abraham-street, and the latter in Albert street. Bail was forfeited in : both in stances. Abuse.—William Savage was. charged with having used abusive, insulting lan guage towards Eobert Higgins.—No ap pearance of either party.-Case struck out. Disobdebly Boys. — Eleven boys, whose ages varied from 16 or 17 to 9 years of age, were charged with having been guilty of disorderly conduct and be haviour on the night of the 7th inst. —One of them pleaded guilty, all the rest not guilty. — The charges against three of them wero withdrawn. A considerable number of tho fathors and mothers of the boys were present in Court.—Mr Bullen said the charge was laid under the fourth section of the Vagrant Act. Ho had very great reluctance in prosecuting those boys, but. it was necessary that something should be done. The Bench and all the citizens wero aware of the aunoyance caused by boys such as those now before tho Court. They congregated at the street corners after dark, and were really a source of terror to persons passing, for they mado use of tho most horrible and filthy lan guago, Ho regretted that any punish' mont which the Bench might inflict would foil on tho parents of the boys, not on themselves; and many of them were beyond-the control of their parents, who would, however, pay tho pecuniary pe nalty, rathor than allow them to be sent to gaol. Unfortuuately, tho law did not provide any other way of proceeding agniaafc them than that now instituted. It would bo told to the Benoh by the wituessos that on tho night in question tho boys now before tho Court and others had congregated on tho beach, near a houso which was used for storing koro sene, whoro thoy wore striking matches aud smoking. Hoveutured to say that overyono of tho boys now before tho Court smoked; for if they had not pipes and tobacco of thoir own, they were sup plied by thoir older companions, and, be sides striking matchos aud endangering properly, they mado uso of very bud language. Tho real prosecutor in this caso would inform tho Court that ho was groatly annoyed by them, on the night in question, by their language and conduct. They brought an obstruction which they placed in front of his door, in order that he might fall over it when he run after them to chase them away. The difficulty that presented itself to Mm was what was best to be done. He had great reluctance in proceeding against such young people, and did not know what course to recommend to the Bench. The penalty, as he said before, would fall on the parents who, in many cases, had enough to do to get on without being called. upon to pay fines for their children's misconduct. He had no wish to send them to jail, but some thing must be done to put.a. strap to their proceedings.—Mr Bullen then called the prosecutor, but, before proceeding to ex amining him, he said that oven at this' stage ho would be glad to withdraw the information against many of the lads if the Bench thought any good could be effected by cautioning them, and if their parents would exercise more control over them. He wouldrathernotproceedagainst the younger ones, but he would have no hesitation in prosecuting the older ones, and would do so in future.—The Chairman, addressing the defendants, said they had heard what Mr Bullen had said, and the description he had given of their, horrible conduct. They were sub ject to a penalty' of three months' im- : prisonment for this offence, but the Court felt disposed to give them another chanee, and tho four bigger boys especially would bo treated very severely if anything of the kind was ever brought against them again. He would ask the police to watch them very carefully. Tho proper punish ment for them would be a good flogging, and an Act was now being prepared which would give the Court the power to have them flogged. If they were caught at such conduct again the Court would by that time be likely to have the power to order them to be flogged in the jail, and they would get punished severely. He would, therefore, advise them seriously to reform their conduct, and with this re proof they were discharged.",0,-0.283865872,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/thames-advertiser/1876/07/15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,50,Notes from Wakatipu.,"(From Our Own Correspondent.) AiuiowTOWN, August 3.— By a la+e notice in your columns I tee that Mr R. Neill, DnneiUn, who bus already introduced many valuable and improved mining appliances, is the agent f""v New Zealanl for an American ruad-malcvr oiid ditch cutter. In both capacities the machine m.ty ba useful to miners, for tracks are as mcec««i tnhe prosecution of mining as water races. Th« machine will cut a water race ftoin sft to Bft wide and 3ft deep as fast as horses drafting la heavy load can walk, and races of lesser dimen sion with proportionate ea3e. The machine as it appears is drawn by horses, six horses and two men being sufficient for tho maximum amount of work. The price is £90. Here in another blow to the unemployed Just when they were to be sent <o bring in racet, dig for gold, and g«norftlly make Central Otago blossom like a rose, here is a machine ready to take the work out of their hands. But the unemployed pan cut >acea where the machine can't got, and that is their salva tion. Speaking of the unemployed, a hint to the Dun edin Miners' Association may if this cource has not already been doculed upon, be wil oined by its members. It is simply that all mining privileges acquired by the association, such as wat.:r raco», claims, tunnels tailr*ces, &c, should be applied for and issued when granted by the warden to the chairman of the association. The rea on -why is plain. If the a«ociation allowed th« experienced minors in charge, whoever they may be, 131 3 acquire the rights referred to in thoir own name, thity might bring in a race or prospect a claim, and when satisfied that tho gold th- roof i* good they might manage things ao that it woulJ not pay, cause the unftmployed to leave it, and afterwards when it is all their own manage otherwise.

138,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,65,ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.,"London, July 30. At the Geographical Congress Dr Murray said he believed that the Antarctic interior was a great continent, and he suggested the landing of a party of young scientists, who would maintain a watch on the Antarctic continent for two winters and carry o,n ex ploring operations. Scientific men willing to undertake the duty could easily be got. The ships would return in the summer. A Government subsidy would be essential to the success of the enterprise. August 1, At the Geographical Conference M. Borch grevinck read a paper on Antarctic explora tion. He recommends Cape Adair as a base for a South Polar expedition. Dog's and sledges could, he said, reach beyend tha south magnetic pole. He offered to lead a landing party to Cape Adair. He estimated the extent of Victoria Land at 8,000,000 square miles. The committee of the conference passed a resolution affirming that the Antarctic region was the greatest field for exploration which still remained to be undertaken, and recom mending the scientific societies of the world to take it in hand before the close of the century. M. Borcbgrevlnck's paper was favourably discussed. Mr Harnsworth, who is financing Jaok son's North Polar expedition, is willing to contribute to a project for Antarctic research, and he believes that Australia will subscribe largely. August 2. Newspapers generally contain complimen tary notices on Herr Borcbgrevinck, Herr Neuneyer, and Dr Murray for their interest displayed in the Antarctic expedition, and declare it is impossible to exaggerate the importance «f the papers read on the subject at the Geographical Conference. Skdnky, August 2. Mr Wragge, the Queensland meteorologist, in a letter to the press with reference to the proposed Antarctic expedition, states that the data obtained would be of the highest importance as bearing on meteorological problems affecting Australia, and that if seasonal forecasting is to be satisfactorily solved for Australia it can only be by means of a complete discussion on Antarctio factors and their bearing on Australian seasons. An immense light, he says, would be thrown on the conditions attaching to the formation and development of disturbances producing some of the heaviest weather and curious seasonal characteristics on the Aus tralian continent. Mr Wragge hopes that the colonies will most cordially assist the pro posal. Wellington, August 1. According to a communication from the Royal Geographical Society the cost of tbe expedition to the Antarctic regions referred to < in yesterday's cables would be £90,000 for two woodf-n vessels, and an equal sum for mainten ance for three years. In a discu-sion at the Philosophical Society's meetiDg on tbe subject, Sir James Hector said it was a blot on our enterprise that so large a portion of the world's surface should remi\iu unexplored. The exploration of the Antarctic region was an absolute necessity, because it was from that region which sprang, to speak in broad terms, all the weather of the whole globe, so that a proper knowledge of what was going on in the extreme south might possibly lead to more correct inferences of possible changes in the weather in every part of the globe.",0,-0.326578827,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The revised official returns give an increase on the previous returns of 219,000 bushels in the colony's wheat yield for the present season The returns show that, excepting in the Mallee dis trict, where there is an increase, the wheat area generally has decreased.

Talriog this into con sideration, prices were well maintained, Some nice moderate-weiglit bullocks' brought up to £9 7s 63, come medium quality up to £8, and some nice cows up to""£7 15s. Some very light weight bullocks not in good condition brought up to £6 ; a lot of. old cows £2 10s to £3 10s. The sale was a dull one, the weather hnvirg acted against the appearance of the cattle, and, I think, the spirits of buyers, too. Cables as to the results of shipments of live cattle are not always reliable. We were all much astonished to hear that the Perthshire [ cattle had brought about £20 per head. It now appears that only a few beasts sold at that price, and that 80 head were sold at £12 or less, and that, considering the condition in which the cattle reached Eugland, people wondered that even that price was reached. This is certainly more like what was expected by those who saw the cattle here. Latest results show that young cattle thrive well, but that old ones do not ; also, that cows and heifers seem to have travelled better than bullocks as a rule. The yarding in the fat sheep pens consisted of 1692 sheep of much inferior quality to those we have seen lately. Indeed, most of the sheep showed signs of haviag been affected by tha bad weather — in fac% looked as if they had gone back a bit. There was very little baying for export, and thi3 soon brought prices down a little, although no great redaction can, I think r fairly be recorded. 'A -few extra prime cross* brects brought over 153, bat about 13s 9d may be quoted as the price of prime wethera ; ewes, 12s 6d to 335 ; for extra prime medium, Us 3d to 12s. The reduction was more noticeable ia the light«r sheap, which are of courte only kid lor by the local trade, and have not the assis tance of any competition from export buyers to help the prices, as is the case with the better classes of sheep: consequently 6s 6d to 8s purohased some fair quality small sheep. There was quite a large yarding of lambs for this season, and some extra prime brought up to 11s 6d, but the majority only realised 4a to 7s. There is no demand for lamb at present. I notice that Mr Lowe, in a speech at the pastoralists' conversazione in Sydney the other day, pnt^ rather a damper on our hopes as to the prospects of a chilled meat trade, as inaugurated by the Gothic shipment. He contended that chilled meat could not be carried longer than 35 days, and that this was proved by the Gothic's engineer having to lower the tempera ture to <27deg Fahr., which, he maintained, was making it practically frozen beef. Now, although I have a greit opinion of Mr Lowe, whose reports on dairy produce and frozen meat I have always commended, I don't agree with him in this respect. The reduction of the temperato re to 27dsg would not by any means turn the meat into frozen beef, as it would require fully 12deg more freezing to accomplish this. I rather think that the precaution taken at Teneriffe of reduc iug the temperature 2deg was a wise one, although it was by no means absolutely neces sary. I think that when I see my friend Mr Reid, the engineer of the Gothio, I shall find that my surmise is correct. I look to this chilled meat experiment as the precursor of much im provement in the frozen meat trade, and I think that vast improvements and economies in the process of freezing are not far off. Mr Brydone read a paper at the same time, which was well received, being practical and to the point. In dealing with the question of the export both of live cattle and sheep and of the chilled meat trade .he said : —""In respecb to the exportation of live cattle and sheep I am afraid the distance .is too great, making the cost and risk more than will enable exportation to be carried on successfully. From what I can learn, the cosb of sending a bullock to London is about £15 and a sheep 35s to 40b, io that when the loss by the way is con sidered there is nothing left for the shipper. But I have greater faith in the chilled meat system for beef, and I believe it will be made successful after a little practice. There is no reason why meat should not be carried at an even tempera' tare of 28deg or 29deg as well as at 15deg or SOdeg. The principal difference in cost between frozen and chilled meat is the extra space re quired for the chilled. Th« calculation is that a ton of frozen beef occupies 90 cubic feet of ■pace and chilled about 230 feet. With prac tice this might be reduced slightly, and if so the cost would come out something like this on the basis of the present rate of |d per lb for frozen beef: Freight _ 175dperlb Killing and Cooling w o*2od n London Charges .. .. o'27d v Insurance and Sacks *.. o'l6d n 233 d per lb or, say, 2_d per lb ; and if the beef sold at an average of 4£d in London that would leave 2d for the beef here, which is double the present price of it in Sydney. As to the future of the meat trade, I am convinced that expenses will become lower. I don't want the shipping com panies to reduce unless they can afford to do fo, bat with improved freezing machinery such as the Linde, the cost is very much reduced. Two tons of coal with such machinery are capable of doing the work of 10 with the old machines, and there is lees labour required. Then if the ships ran carry cheaper London storage should also be cheaper, and every little helps."" I agree with Mr Brjdone's remarks, and in any case the live meat trade can never, I think, overtake production here, and we mast look to improvements in, and reductions in the cost of, the chilling and freezing to help us much, and these are on the way I think. Mr Davies, general manager of the Naomi S*astor*l Company, at the same time and place summed up the situation after an able speech shortly as follows: — ""I consider the paetoral outlook is not all black, but what we want to make it bright is (1) cheap money, (2) dear wool, (3) a fair cut at the retail price of our meat in London. Add to these fair average seasons, and not too much legislation."" A capital prescription, Mr Davies, suitable alike to Australia and New Zealand, and may all things needful to make it np be shortly within our reach ; but weshall have to work for some ef them. Mr T. Brydone, on being asked his opinion as to the Sydney fltud sheep sales, said that the result was jasb about what he expected, and that unless he had known that he could place his sheep on bis company's own properties in Queensland and New South Wales he would not have sent any sheep over. He also told several interviewers in Sydney that the result of theie sales would, he thought, destroy them for next year so far as New Zealand shippers were concerned, and that if they wanted New Zealand sheep in future they would have to send for them. This seems to me about right, and now that Australian pastoraliste have during the past two years seen our sheep, and h»ve had ample opportunity of noting the quality and character of the different breeders' lobs, there is no nesd for us sending sheep over there again. Those who really want them will come for them. We have our ram fairs here, which should provide a good opportunity. It must be quite apparent that the system of sending sheep from here for sale by auction in Sydney is a bad one, although perhaps it may have served a pur pose in making our sheep known. Let it rest there, and don't do it again. Auctioneers may tempt breeders next year. "" Will you walk into my parlour ? * Said the spider to the fly. But we won't, I hope. Having got our ex perience, and paid handsomely for it, we shall aot on it. I was one of the first in New Zealand to advocate the use of pollard poisoning for rabbits, and I see no reason to alter my opinion. As a summer poison it has proved very success ful, and I have the testimony of several ex perienced men that it is equally good as a winter poison. As to its poisoning stock, I think such has been the case to only a very small extent, and even this is quite avoidable by care. Some writers, I notice, declare that wire netting is no use. To this I Eay that nothing we can do is any use unless done well and carefully. Personally, I believe the rabbit to be a pest of the worst description, and one that should if possible be fought with till rabbits are exter minated, if such a result can be attained. I have advocated pollard poisoning and a big Government; scheme for supplying wire netting to farmers at a low price, and with payments for it extending over a number of years, and am always on the outlook for other schemes which may be found likely to prove effec tive. I have also frequently stated my opinion that all, attempts to make the rabbit export trade a commercial success must end in failure, and that all such attempts, either in frozen rabbit, tinned rabbit, or rabbitskins, are de cidedly detrimental to any scheme either by Government or individuals who desire to lessen or get rid of the pest as quickly as possible. Doubtless there may be some of a contrary opinion, and it is a matter of history that the rabbit was looked upon as a most desirable colonist by some of our most enterprising and intelligent leading men. Many of my readers will remember how much interest was taken in the welfare of the pioneer rabbits, and how a thrill of pleasure much akin to what we now feel as to the successful Gothic chilled beef experiment ran through Southland and Otago when it was announced that these pioneers were breeding nicely. These are times of rapid and startling changes. Ladies give up wear ing merinos, and owing to the many freaks and whims of fashion it is diffi cult to say what kind of wool will be in demand in a year or two, or, indeed, whether wool will b8 used at all. Some nice material from Japan or elsewhere may kneck everything else out. So with mutton and beef ; it may go oat of fashion too, and rabbits may come in and justify the enterprise of the early importers of rabbits to this colony. If such a time should come, they or their descendants will doubtless claim the honour due to such foresight At present, however, the honour is a doubtful one, and were I to name the parties to whom the credit is due, the editor of the Witness might shortly be engaged in an expen sive law suit, so I refrain. This, however, is all apropos of a little volume called "" The Wild Rabbit"" (Messrs Wm. Black wood and Sons, Edinburgh), by I. Simpson, which I commend to the careful study of all would-be rabbit farmers. It is written for Home farmers, and a reviewer says of it that in these unfortunately depressing times it is well to turn to every side for relief; that in the production of rabbits there is a proopeot of fair remuneration; and that the book is well worthy of careful perusal. Mr Gladstone advised the British agriculturist to turn his attention to poultry and straw berries, but Mr Simpson pins his faith on rabbits, if haply the wicked landlord or his game tenant will not exercise his sporting rights over this farming industry ; and he says that doubtless the owner of the soil in these days of serious depression will give the farmer the right to shoot his own rabbits. That matter settled, all is plain sailing, and we in New Zealand have no such difficulties. Simpson's book shows that from experiments he has made it is possible to feed 100 rabbits per acre on natural grass alone, which at Is per rabbit means a return of £5 per acre; From this, however, he deducts in terest on the erection of suitable fences and the expense of forming artificial barrows, which expenses are, however, not very much. He suggests a field of 10 acres as sufficient for farmers to make a first experiment on. He is, however, careful to explain that you cannot ex pect the flesh and bone represented by 100 rabbits an acre to be removed from the soil without some equivalent being restored to it. He recommends gaa lime in winter and salt in April as efficient and economical fertilisers, and also recommends dry lands. As to the lands, we have plenty ' suitable, I think, and as to the manures or fertilisers, here is a chance for manufacturers— a patent fertiliser not made of dead rabbits, but one for the proper production of live ones t Government might be asked to carry this ferti liser free, so as to encourage farmers desiring to push a trade. A very charming book — it has given me much pleasure. I think the Agicul tural department might be asked to publish it in parts along with the noxious weeds circulars. To all who believe in the rabbit as an article of commerce the book must be useful, as the instruction is practical, and if it is duly studied it will enable them to carry oat their ideas well • and if a thing's worth doing it's worth doing well. The demand for good draught horses is active, and the present is a good time for those who have such horses for sale, the demand being caused by the need of horses to get the ploughing, already too long delayed, done as rapidly as possible. The supply of draughts at our town yards has of late been quite unequal to the demand, and good prices are the rule, and I fancy even these will improve. Good four to six year old draughts bring from £20 to £25 ; sound eight to ten year old, from £15 to £20. The Brookside milking machine seems to be making way. A gentleman informs me that he saw 20 cows milked in half an hour, and milked well, very few requiring to be stripped after the machine had done its work. The cows were a mixed lot, with long teats and fleshy udders, and there were heifers with small teats that required the use of one's fiDger and thumb only when hand milked. The cows were contented, ohewing the cud during the—process. A man and"" two small boy a to bail-up milked between 30 and 40 cowb pp r hour, and some think that the milking machine will do as'Tnuch good to farmers as the reaper and binder. One great advantage is that the machine is evea-tempered, and does not kick or bully the cows, and this is a great matter. If the machine is reliable as a good stripper it is a very great point in its favour. Payment by test for milk will bring the importance of strip ping more into prominence. Not only is money to be lost by not properly stripping the cows, but nothing tends more to impair their milking capacities. The Minister for Railways in his report alludes to a reduction in freight on dairy pro duce as contemplated. The Canadian cheese market appears to have opened at 7 to 1_ cents in Canada, equal to about 3£d per lb, and as they can land their cheese in London at Id more, this indicates a low range of price. The tendency, however, is towards firmness and a possible advance. The rise in wheat is causing some farmers all over the world to lessen their dairying, and the dry season in England and Europe may kelp towards an im provement in price, but I do not think that for a time there can be aaything like a rise to a decent figure. But one never knows, and I hope the un expected may happen this tima. Those who advocate sales by auction in Lon. don as calculated to help the butter and cheese trada have, it seema to me, an uphill job to prove the wisdom of what they advise. I some time ago gave quotations which were sufficiently disastrous, bub the results of the last auction were simply awful, some of oar cheese from Otago and Southland going at 24s to 32s per owt. Sales of some of the same by brokers in the usual way gave 8s to 10s better results at the same time, so I don't think much of the auctions. Of course I may be told that this method may im prove with time and trial. Well, I think it just as well to let any of our neighbours who believe in this method try it further, bat I don't believe in it at all, and the experiment of trying it farther is far too disastrous. . I shall wait with some interest to see whom the Government appoint to go Home to watch our cheese and butter interests. If a really good man is appointed, some good will re3ulfc, but any thing short of a first-class man will be worse than useless, and great difficulty will be found is getting a man to fill the requirements properly.",0,-0.404744772,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

113,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,40,Automatic Wire Tightener.,"tO THE EDITOR. Sir,— Kindly allow me space in your valuable paper to correct a wrong impression which has by some means got circulated among farmers and merchants— viz., that the patent ""'automatic wiie tightener"" is a wire strainer and mender. Allow me to positively assert that such is uot the case. The automatic wire tightener "" is not used either for straining up fences or mending fences, neither was it invented for either of those pur poses. With your permission I will explain, for the benefit of those who do not understand, what the "" automatic wire tightener "" is used for. The machine above referred to waß invented to fill a long-felt want— viz ,to keep fences tight the year through without any further trouble than of putting'the ""tightener"" in the fence and tighten ing it up to the required degree of tension at the start. When this machine is once set, there is no necessity to bother about fences Retting slack or the breaking of wires by contraction. When the sun shinea and the fence wires expand, this machine takes up the expansion. If 1% freezes and your wire 3 contract, the "" tighteeer "" ia equal to the occasion, and is compressed, slacking the wires»to the required degree of tension at which the machine is lirst set. The fes cc requires no periodical straining up or sUckeninp, as with the ordinary wire strainers. This self-acting machine is a time and labour saver, and a great economiger in the me of wiro, ami a No. 11 wire can be used in the place of a N<\ Bby the old method. A coil of No. 8 wire contain» about 573 yd», whereas a coil of Np. 11 wire contain- 'lOSpyds, a difference of 22 chains, which means a saving of one-fourth of a mile of wire in every mile erected for »heep. The trouble was to get a thin wiie to keep tight for any length of tima without getting too riack or breaking, hence the use of so much heavy wive, A No. 11 wire can be kept at the same degrte of tension the year through by the ""auto matic wire tightener "" easier than you could keep a No. S wire hy the oM method of wire at.rainera. In these hard times if we c«n save three or four coils of wire to the mile, and ensure a reduction of freight by using lighter postx and standards, and always have our fences tig'u without having any trouble looking after them, I feel sure ib will be a boon to both runholder aud farmer.

Ycl, Baxter seconded Vdl, Herbert Brought it was a pity to break up the Company just now, as there would soon be a number of young men employed close to town, and nc doubt many ox them would be glad of an opportunity of receiving a little drill as well as having a certain method of spending a portion of their evenings, and he should certainly op pose the resolution. Color-SergY Potts thought if there was a probability ox the Company being properly supported, lie should be very sorry to see it disbanded, but unless it was to be better supported than it had been lately it would ba better to disband at once. So far as he was personally concerned he would still continue to support the Company if it remained on service, but he should under any circumstances, resign Ms color -sergeant stripes as ho would not be able to giro the time .necessary to the proper eairying out of the duties, pertaining to the office, for some time, as he would be employed chiefly in the country for a considerable period but he would attend parades, and do what no could in. any other way, L : a Hamertou said he hoped the men would consider well what continu ing meant, before they decided on their future course, as it was simply an in sult to the uniform to carry on a Company as that had lately been car ried on Some stress had been laid on the fact that several youngmen would join shortly, he regretted to have to say that his experience of Patea young men did not induce the ioj)o ox ranch. £io -.-fintatj o to he derived from such a source, as, so far as ha could judge, the principal* ambition of tho young men was to do a square loaf ” at a street corner, for all present had doubtless seen mem bers of the corps lolling’ about the streets a full half hour after parade time, and he could assure them that was not the sort of “stuff ’’ out of which to make a good company of Volunteers- If the men had not suffi cient e?pnt de corps iu them to bring them to parade punctually, and pro perly uniformed and accoutred, they were much better out of it than, in it, and so far as his personal opinion went he could assure them he would either have them on parade or off the roll, which ever they liked best, and he trusted Capt Adams was of the same opinion. Ho hoped they would consider this before coming to their decision, Ho would remind them. thab v it merely meant the sacrifice of two hours ou one night a month, and the man who, having undertaken to do that,had not moral courage and deter mination enough to carry it out, was not worthy of the name of man or the honour of wearing a volunteer uni form. There was also anoth r matter he would like them to thiuk uver, but this was not a ‘‘duty” matter He did not believe in a corps being ‘ run * simply for the benefit of half a .-dozen. ‘ shootists,’ every encouragement should"" be giveu to them, of course, but half a dozen shootists did not make a Company, and the rest of the Com pany deserved some consideration. It had always been a habit with Volun teer Companies to which ho had be longed (and he had been a Volunteer ever since 18-57) to have a days outing in the summer. They should take a day in the country with their wives and sweethearts, and show that they were a body of men who could work to gether in other places than in the drill shed; that they had full confi dence in each other at play as well as at drill, and they could depend upon it a much better, and more popular, positiou would quickly be taken by the corps, which would greatly tend to engender that spirit of emulation without whhh no corps could success - fully exist. Capt. Adonis said if the men de cided to continue in the corps they must understand that much more punctual attendance would be necas sary than had been the case during the past year. He was sorry to say that very great difficulty had occurred at times to get a sufficient 5 number on parade to be able to count for capita tion, and he would not again undergo the same amount of trouble and anxiety on any account. lie must also tell them that the habit which had been obtained in Patea, but which he had never seen anywhere else, of calling the roll at the close of the parade would also have to he dis continued, and the roll would be called by the Colour Sergeant before handing his parade over to the officer in the command, this would necessitate mure punctual attendance, but with only a parade or two a mouth it could not ho considered any hardship. lie had no doubt if the members made nn their minds to stick together the Com pany could be carried on very suc cessfully, but ho wanted them to understand that continuing _ meant regular attendance on parade, and lilies for non a tendance would be en forced in accordance with the regular tie as. On the receipt of the capitation now earned, the Company would be in a very sound financial position. There would be no liabilities ; the uniforms were now j and there woul.l oe u cosh balance in the bank, so they had nothing to fear in. that way, and they would bo able to hj ivc some prizes 10 shoot for. ieergt Harris said, like dergt Polls, ho wo'uj.d resign his stripes CMi tinned in the Company, as the lesson he had had during the last eight months was quite enough, for him, the trouble there had been in getting the parades together so as ;o enable those who attended regularly to he able to earn the capitation for the company ’'•was sufficient to disguest anyone with volunteering, and he should not think of again acting as Secretary to the Company, or of retaining his stripes and if the members decided to con tinue it would have to be under very t different circumstances from the past eight or nine months No other member wishing to speak the resolution was put and lost, by an overwhelming majority, only six voting’ for it.

The circum stances under which they were perpe tuited were as follows.— Numerous- peasants and workmen from the interior of lloumania have been in the habit of crossing the Danube at the above mentioned port for the pur pose of seeking labour in Bulgaria, but on their return journey with their sav ings, fearing the indiscreet questions of the Ronoia dan Customs officials, the travellers have long evaded them by landing on a small island in the Dan ube, whether they were rowed by Tur kish or Bulgarian boatmen, mostly dur ing the night. From this island it was possible to Roumanian shore in different ways unnoticed by the authorities. Home time ago a soldier, accidentally walking on the banks of the river, heard terrible screams issuing apparently from some reeds near that island. After a silence of several horns similar screams were again heard by persons whom the soldier had called to the spot. On the police proceeding thither they found that on b.<th occa sions pars Dus crossing the river and landing on the island had been mur dered by their own boatmen, A com prehensive inquiry was now instituted by the Roumanian Fiscal-General, M.

279,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,206,THE STRONG MAN IN MUSIC.,"While we are very far from contending that the mere exhibition of physical force is a thing to be admired in the realm of art, it may not be without profit to observe bow far the possession of power and endurance, or the cultivation of the athletic instinct, has conduced to success in the annal3 of the art. To begin with, inasmuch as the commonest of all Philistine objections to the musical profession is that it tends to effeminacy, there can be no doubt that the general popularity of a singer or player is considerably enhanced by the knowledge that he can hold bis own in other spheres of activity than those ex clusively connected with his calling. la the case of instrumental executants the seden tary conditions of their life, and the caie tbay have to take of their fir»gere, render it difficult for them to devote their attention to out- door or violent pursuits. A great pianist or violinist can never hope to excel as a wicket-keeper. It would not do for Herr Burmester, for example, to stand up to Richardson's or Woodcock's deliveries; or for M. Paderewski to keep goal In an Association football match. Still, if ona looks at the list of muiricians who have achieved distinction in the course of the century, it is qnite refreshing to find what a creditable proportion have given the lie t9 ihe view that the service of art is incom patible with a taste for manly and atbletio fcunraits. Standigl, one of the finest Bingere of the century, was a keen sports man, who, while fulfilling his operatic engagements at Vienna, used constantly to spend bis days in hunting expeditions in the neighbourhood. Aa for Mendelssohn, it is well known that, though not endowed with & robust physique, there were few pastimes In which he did not excel. He was an ex cellent billiard player, very fond of gymna stics and riding, and a good dancer and swimmer. ! Rubinstein's immense strength was con clusively exhibited at the keyboard. As for Ole Bull, who was a splendidly-made man, there is a delightful story of how Liszt, in the year 1840, once ordered him to execute summary punishment on a manager who had endeavoured to sow dissension between the violinist and the pianist. The culprit was invited to breakfast, after which he was subjected to a searching cross-examination, and anally Liszt pronounced sentence as follows : — "" Ole Bull, I charge you to take this man and hold him at arm's length oat of the window"" — they were in a room on the third storey — ""until he confesses."" The order waß promptly carried out, for Ole Bull had mucoles of steel, and the wretched manager was kept danglieg in mid air until lie had confessed hismisdeeds. A few years later on a Mußiesippi steamboat, some rough fellows having insulted Oie Bull, he chal lenged the strongest of them to a wrestling match and threw him over his head. Sub sequently Ole Bull heard of the same fellow as having gone to an editor to call him to account for an adverse criticism on his play ing, and expressing his readiness to fight for "" the strongest fiddler he bad ever seen, any how."" Lablache was a Stentor and Samson in one. ""His strength,"" writeß Mr Julian Marshall, ""was enormous. 'AsLeporollo he sometimes carried eff under one arm, ap parently without effort, the troublesome Masetto, represented by Giubilel, a man of the full height and weight of ordinary men 1 Again, in an interval of tedious rehearsing, he was once seen on the stage to piok-up with one hand a doable bass that was stand ing in the orchestra, examine it at arm's length, and gently replace it where he bad found it 1 The force of his voice exceeded when be chose the tone ot the instruments that accompanied it and the noise and clamour of the stage; nothing drowned his portentous notes, which rang through the house like the booming of a great bell."" Certainly bis strength was no drawback to Lablaohe, who was not only one of the greatest singers, bat one of the most honour able men who ever adorned the profession, and who deserves to live long in grateful re membrance if only for his generosity in defraying, out of his own pocket, the fees of the operatic singers who took part in the performance of Mozart's "" Requiem "" after •^Beethoven's death.

224,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,151,POULTRY FOR THE TABLE AND FOR EXPORTATION.,"At the annual meeting of the Otago Agricul tural and Pastoral Society, held on July 27, a proposition was brought forward by Mr James which was remitted to the incoming committee for consideration — namely, the advisability of giving greater prominence to the exhibition of dead poultry at the society's winter Bhow, and offering inducement to make the exhibition both An instructive and a remunerative one to, the farmers. It is well known that a large quantity of p»ultry of all descriptions is being exported from the Australasian colonies, and that from recent advices remunerative returns have been received. These advices show that, like the frozen mutton, none but the beat will suit the market, which must be shipped at certain seasons of the year •well within ■* the reach of the New Zealand breeder. It is equally well known that as a rule very little goad table poultry is to be ob tained here. Indeed it has been said that the poultry societies have missed what should be their true aim. and have been breeding for feather instead of for usefulness in the flesh and egg-producing qualities. The proposition brought forward by Mr James is that the society should offer prizes, and in this leipfrct we believe the money would be readily subscribed privately to induce the poultry breeders, and especially the farmers, to take an interest in the matter ; the conditions attached to the exhibition to be such as have never, we ""be lieve, at least in these colonies, been attempted, but which would be very easy and very instruc tive to the breeders. These are : (1) That all poultry shown must be under 12 months old, or it would not suit the English market. (2) That it be shown alive on the first day of the show, and its live weight mentioned on the show pen. (3) That «ach pen be killed by a person specially appointed, and shown on the second amd third days of the show with both the live and dead weights attached. (I) Either pure or crossbred poultry may be shown, but if crossbred the dutinct crosses of either sex to be mentioned. We are of opinion that the scheme here out lined would prove a very useful and instructive lesson. We certainly hare not heard that any agricultural or poultry association has so far teld an exhibition of poultry shown both alive *nd dressed for the table, with weight in both rases attached, showing the amount of offal, size of bone, &o. Wo intend referring to this subject again shortly, giving extracts from Australasian journals of the returns received on account of poultry exported, and the British opinion of the mode of breeding to obtain the best results.

A party from Christchuroh intend proceeding to Mount Herbert for the purpose of obtaining a few hours' tobogganing on the snow clad hill sides of the mountain. Following up the remarks we (Wellington Post) made some time since about the New Zealand frostflsh, we mar mention that a larger number has been taken on the Otaki and Manawatu beaches this winter than for several years past. Some of these were of large size, measuring nearly 4ft from the point of their finely-produced nozzle to the tip of the tail. A few have found their way into the Wellington market, where they have met with a ready sale at two shillings a pound. But the Maoris, who willingly spend a bitterly cold night on the sands on the chance of picking up a frostfish in the early dawn, before the sea-birds have feasted on it, appreciate the quality of this delicate fish, and reserve it for home consump tion, A, few have beco tent; to England in tho freezing chambers, and although losing some what of the delicate flavour in the process of refrigerating, it has been declared by epicores one of the most delicious fish in the world. It has, we believe, more than once been a fea ture in the menu at Lord Onslow's celebrated parliamentary dinners. The frequency of its occurrence this season is no doubt due to tho exceptional coldness we have had this winter. Hares are, according fo the o*mnru Mail, so tame in the back country just now that great difficulty is experiencad in driving them off turnips which have bsen put down for sheep.

276,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,203,THE BEAU-IDEAL OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.,"An Incident in a Frontier Fight. Roman Nose was a man over 6ft 3in in height, beautifully formed, and, save for a crimson silk sash knotted around his waist and his rnoccaeins on his feet, perfectly naked. His face was hideously painted in alternate lines of red and black, and bis head crowned with a magnificent war bonnet, from whicb, just above his temples and curv iDg slightly forward, stood up two short black buffalo horns, while its ample length of eagle's feathers and herons' plumes trailed wildly on the wind behind him ; and as he came swiftly on at the head of bis charging warriors in all his barbaric strength and grandeur, he proudly rode that day tha most perfect type of a savage warrior it bad been my lot to see. Turning his face for an in stant towards the women and children of the united tribes, who literally by thousands were watching the fight from the crest of the low bluffs back from the river's bank, he raised bis right arm and waved his hand with a royal gesture in answer to their wild cries of raga and encouragement as he and hia command swept down upon us ; and again facing squarely towards where we lay,"" he drew bis body to its full height and shook his clinched fiat defiantly at U3 ; then throw ing baok bis bead and glancing skywards, he suddenly struck the palm of bis hand across his mouth and gave tongae to a war cry that I have never yet heard equalled in power and intensity. Scarcely had its echoes reached the river's bank when it was caught up by each and every one of the charging warriors with an energy that baffles description, and answered back with blood-curdling yells of exultation and prospective vengaance by the women and children on the river's bluff* and by the Indians who lay in ambush around us. Oa they came at & swinging gallop, rending the air with their wild war whoops, each individual warrior in all his bravery of war paint and long, braided scalp lock tipped with eagles' feather?, and all stark naked but for their cartridge belts and moccasins, keep ing their line almost perfectly, with a front of about 60 men, all riding bareback, with only a loose lariat about their horses' bodies, about a yard apart, and with a depth of six or seven ranks, forming together a compact body of massive lighting strength and of almost resistless weight. ""Baldly they rode, and well,"" with their horses' bridles in their left hand?, while with their right they grasped their rifles at the guard, and held them squarely in front of them selves, resting lightly upon their horses' necks. Riding about five paces in front of the centre of the line, and twirling his heavy Spriagfiald rifle around his head as if it were a wi?p of straw (probably one of those he had captured at the Forb Fefcterman massacre), Roman Nose recklessly led the charge with a bravery that could only be equalled but not excelled, while their medicine man, an equally brave but older chief, rode slightly in advance of the left of the charging column. To say that I was surprised at this splendid exhibition of pluck and discipline is to put it mildly, and to say, further, that for an instant or two I was fairly lost in admiration of the glorious charge i* simply to state the truth, for it was far and away beyond anything I had heard of, read about, or even imagined regarding Indian warfare. A quick back ward gl&ncs at my men was most reassuring. The scouts had turned in their rifle pits to wards the direction from which the charge was coming, crouching low and leaning for ward. With their knees well under them, their rifles grasped with a grip of steel in their brown sinewy hands, their chests heaving with excitement, their teeth set hard, their nostrils a- quiver, their bronzed countenances fairly aflame, and their eyes flashing fire, they grimly lay waiting the word of command, as brave and gallant a little company of men as ever yet upheld the reputation of Anglo- Saxon courage. No sooner were the charging warriors fairly under way than a withering fire was suddenly poured in upon us by those of the Indians who lay in ambush around us intently watching our every movement, in the vain hope that they might sufficiently cow us to protect their charging column against our rifles. I had expected this action, bat I well knew that once their horsemen came within a certain radius their fire must cease. For eight or ten seconds it seemed to rain bullets, and then came a suddon lull. Sitting upright in my pit as well aa I was able, and leaning backward on my elbows, I shouted, "" Now ! "" and "" Now I "" was echoed by Beecher, M'Oall, and Grover. Instantly the scouts were on their knees with their rifles at their shoulders. A quick flash of their eyes along the barrels, and 40 good men and true sent their first of seven successive volleys into the ranks of the charging warriors. Crash ! On they come, answering baok the first volley with a ringing war-whoop. Crash 1 And now I begin to see falling warriors — aye, and horses too ; but still they sweep forward with yet wilder yells. Crash I They see m to be fairly falling over each other ; both men and horses are down in heaps, and wild shrieks from the women and children on the hills proclaim that they too see the slaughter of their braves ; but still they come. Crash I They have ceased to yell, but yet come bravely on. What 1 No 1 £es, down goes their medicine man ; but Roman Nose still recklessly leads the column ; bat now I can see great gaps in their ranks, showing that our bullets have told heavily among them. Crash 1 Can I believe my eyes 1 Roman Nose is down ! He and hia horse lie dead together on the sand, and for an instant the column shakes ; but 100 yds more and they are upon us I Crash I They stagger I They half draw rein 1 They hesitate I They are breaking ! Crash) And, like an angry wave $b,a. v jaurlfl iteejb? upon a mighty rook and breaks upon its rugged front, the Indians divide each'side of the little breastwork, throw themselves almost beneath the off side of their chargers, and with hoarse cries of rage and anguish break for either bank of the river, and soatter wildly in every direction, as the scouts, springing to their feet with a ringing cheer, pour in volley after volley from theii revolvers almost in the very faces of their now de moralised and retreating foe. "" Down men 1 lie down 1 "" 1 fairly shriek. "" Get down 1 down for ypur lives ! "" cries M'OaU. And tho men, hurling bitter taunts and imprecations after the retreating savages, throw themselves, panting, flat on their faces inside of their rifle pits just in time to escape a scorching volley from the Indians still lying in ambush around us, who have been anxiously watching the charge, and natu rally enough are wildly enraged at its failure. As for myself, a single shot from my rifle, and a few from my revolver just at the clo&e of tho charge, was all that I could do in my crippled state ; bub the fact that I had to lie flat upon my back, craning my head forward, had, by placing me below the plane of fire, enabled me to watch every phase of the In dians' desperate charge. Bat now, to me, came the hardest blow of the whole day. Lieutenant Bsecher rose from his rifle pit, and, leaning on his rifle, half staggered, half dragged himself to where I lay, and calmly lyiog down by my aide, with his face turned down on his arm, said, quietly and simply : "" I have my death wound, General. I am shot in the side, and dying."" 11 Oh, no, Beecber — no 1 It can't be as bad as that 1 "" 11 Yes. Good-night."" And then he imme diately sank into half unconsciousness. In a few moments I heard him murmur, ""My poor mother 1 "" and then he soon grew slightly delirious, and at time 3 I could hear him talking ia a semi-unconscious manner about the fight ; but he was never again fully conscious, and at sanset his life went out. And thus perished one of the bast and bravest officers in the United States army. — Harper's New Monthly.",0,-0.569108652,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing will meet the necessities of the case but a general resigna tion of the force in Auckland. If the marks men are to testify their sense of injustice, let every volumc.r stand by them. Had greater unity and persistence been manifes ted when the inferiority of the weapon and excessive minimum necessary to qualify were first brought under public notice, the .light which the force has suffered would never have been placed upon it There ia yet time for the volunteers to show the Government that they feel and will resent the injustice, ami wo would, therefore , suggest that a general meeting of all the corps be convened for the purpose of determining upon some decisive form of action. The reply from the Govern ment runs to the effect; that "" it does not see why Anckland volunteers should be placed on an exceptional footing to that of other volunteers.""

On the morning of the 15 inst, in a fresh E.S.E. gale, with a heavy sea running, he sighted a vessel with distress signals flying. On inspection he found it was the Proudfoot ..lightship, that had broken away from her moorings six days before, and had been driving helplessly in a gale -towards the Ne>v Guinea coast. They signalled from the lightship, "" Take us in tow ; we want immediate assistance."" When the Glen lochy hove in sight sharks in.hundreds were round the lightship, and as the Glenlocby's boat ran out a line for the hawser, the crew had to smash at the monsters with boat-hooks. The lightship had brought up before the Glenoehy ap peared on the scene, but it was in 27 fathoms, and as the sea continued very high, it was with no little danger that towing lines were got aboard the lightship, which pitched and rolled all the time. The heavy moorings of the lightship it Was found impossible to heave up, so they were slipped and buoyed. : A story is going the rounds which though not new is certainly good enough to bear repetition at the present juncture.

The attendance was expected to be a large one, more particularly as it was announced to be the last Saturday's run of the eeason. Although not quite up to anticipa tions, the gathering was .fairly numerous, and included Mr F. Stroiachon Patrol; Mr Reid, Kelly ; Mr Patterson, Stockings ; Mr S. Gourley, Waitangi ; Mr Nixon, Jack Hark away ;Mr Thomas Cotton, Dun-'envAll ; Mr Biird, Dunraven ; Mr Orhell, Dundonald ; 'Mr Farquharsou, Signal; Mr M'Beath, Albion; Mr R. Parker, ' Moonlight ; Mr Moore, jun., Lady Teddington ; Mr Roberts, a brown; Mr F. • Hjman, Echo; Frank Smith (huntsman), Digby ; J 'Bomber, Toxa, and in the second run Dunblane ; Mrs Swanson, Duntrina ; Mus Macdonald, Fancy ; Mrs Walcot, Garnet ; Miss Farquhar son, Silvermaid. Mrs Silk drove her grey »nd phaeton; Mr Reid, (of Southland), a >horsu aud buggy*; Mr J. Ellis, buggy and pair; Me Ritchie, buggy and pair ; Mr Oaborne, buggy and pair of ponies. The drag was despatched, as usual, from Mr Kedzlfo's home stead, and was over the same country as former m> ets. The hounds were in capital condition, and were very eager ; but"", although the pace was fast, there were no spills in either of th« runs, which seemed to be much enjoyed by the followers and spectators. The one lady follower was well up at the finish in each run. This was given out to be ihe last Saturday's fixture in the Dunedin district for this season, although it was intended to have a Wednesday's bub since then arrangements h*ve been entered into for the pack to -proceed to Tapanui and Gore. It is probable when they return another day's sport will be held, of which due notice will be given. The pas: season, although the severe weather ha 3 interfered with sport, and was the means ■of a number of fixtures biiog postponed, bas b?eu a fairly successful one ; and although falls were rather plentiful, no one suffered more than a shaking — if we except Mr Anderson, who broke a collar-bone. .The sport evidently increases in popularity in Dunedin. It has been' fairly supported, and although commercial depression and the changes and vioits'tudes of colonial life caused the loss- of< some of the best and Btaunchesfc members, still the hunt has fairly, held its own. It ""h ia manjy and health-giving paßtime,;and nothing engenders good fellowship and equalises all classes like the hunting field. I have the authority of the eecretaryfor stating that some of the~best patrons in sup porting the hunt have been ladies. The' curtain must now be rung down, and boots and breeches be relegated for a' time to obscurity. I think a word of praise is due from followers to the huntsman (Frank Smith) and the whip (J. Bamber), who have both ptfformed their duties in the field in a very efficient manner. Thanks are also due to the landowners who gave the use of their land, going in some in stances to considerable trouble, and without whose co-operation no sport could be bad. Nimeod. Messrs R. Bell and Co.'s vesta manufactory at Wellington is now in full operation, and their vestas are on the market.

Grey's election for the Thames, the Gross has the > following:— As respects the decision of the Elec tion Committee on the petition, alleging the invalidity of the Thames election, of course that decision will form a precedent; but we maintain it is a dangerous precedent which affirms that a member already duly elected without opposition' shall be entitled to contest a second seat, seeing that it is impossible he can sit for two. what under such ruling, is to prevents powerf nl can didate, who may exercise a vast influence, from being similarly elected, not for two, but for ten' seats, and holding all of them, and sitting in the House, pending what might prove to be' a long ■• sittiog of the election committee of inquiry into the validity of only one of the ten? On the prin ciple laid down by the practice now established, ' if but one of these ten seats'was made the sub ject of an election petition, absolutely nine seats might remain vacant for a month or more, in asmuch as, pending the decision on such solitary petition, the right of choice would be restricted until that decision was arrived at, and conse quently eight or nine duly-elected members would be debarred from sitting, and during their absence an unjustly-obtained. ; majority might be employed, by one man, either for or against, the Ministry of the day. This may be termed a reductio .. ad absurdam,, because such a thing is riot likely to, occur as one man being elected for so many as ten, or even half-a-dozen seats; but this'is the principle ac tually laid down by Parliament, and we have only extended it to a perfectly legitimate and logical conclusion. It may be sound Parlia- law, but it is unquestionably bad practice, and its result is seen in the deprivation of a large constituency for nearly half the ses sion of one of its representatives.

This in tnm had been caused by confinement to his desk and grief at the loss of dear friends by- death The coming on of this strange disease, as described by Mr Itichold, must be of interest both to sick and well He had noticed for several years previously, in fact, that his eyes and face began to have a yellow look ; there was a sticky and unpleasant slime on the gums and teeth in the morning ; the tongue coated; and the bowels so bound and costive that it induced that most painful and trouble some ailment —the piles He say? there was some pain in the sides and back and a sense of fullne s on the right side, as though the liver were enlarging, which proved to be the terrible fac The secretions from the kid neys would be scanty and high-coloured with a kind of gritty or sandy deposit afte, standing These things had troubled Mrc ’.

273,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,200,Rambles NATURES WONDERLANDS,"MR THOMSON ON CRUSTACEA. MR THOMSON ON CRUSTACEA. It is unfortunately but seldom that the in habitants of Dunedin have an opportunity of listening to such lectures as that delivered by Mr George M. Thomson, F.L.S., last Friday night upon ""The Crustacea: a Study in Development."" To very many among us the mere suggestion of listening to addresses upon scientific subjects acts like Mr Brown's famous motion in the Sooiety npon the Stanislaus. In altogether too many instances young men are growing up without the least deßire to understand anything of the nature of the universe which surrounds them. In many instances this state of things is due, no doubt, to mere stupidity, but in others it appears to me to be tbe outcome of a peouliar mental slothfulness which is the reverse of creditable to those who own it. It is almost useless to remind those to whom I allade that horse-raciDg, football playing, and such like diversions are merely of the nature of amusement, or at best recreation, and that their place is after, not in precedence to, matters of real and solid import ; of too muob book-reading also the same may be said. As Mr Waddell urged only last week, too much reading stupefies rather than clears the understanding — of the young especially. Reading and nothing but reading is a poor sort of hobby ; far better that our boys, everyone of them, and girls too for that matter, should take to some real working hobby, and the right field in which to find such a horse is the field of science. And it .ia necessary also, if we are to maintain the advantages which our forefathers so painfully won for u§, that we should be, as Dick Mortiboy put it, "" steeped in science."" Anyone looking abroad upon the world with seeing eyes must perceive tbat the ball mark of science Is upon all tbat is best in the world to-day. This is to be seen in every department of human thought and activity ; in the inventiveness of the age — for inven tion is the outcome of science solely — as well as in its triumphs of pure knowledge. Oaly those nations are ascendant in civilisation and strength which are great in their devo tion to science— Great Britain, Germany, France, America— others lag behind, some of them a long way astern. But what has this to do with a lecture on Crustacea? Jasfc this, that neither Mr Thomson nor anyone else can tell ub truth fully about living things without pointing some moral in regard to their evolution, and it is just for their value as bearing upon Evolu tion in the most comprehensive sense that we ought to chiefly value such discourses. In this instance the lecturer told many interest ing things while on the way to his moral — first reminding us of the culinary value of many crustaceans, then dwelling for a space upon their value as an economic force in Nature, acting, as very many of them do, as "" scavengers of the seas,"" and, we may add, to a less extent, of the fresh waters also. Popular misconceptions regarding the Crustacea abound, and are constantly re peated. Crabs, oysters, lobsters, cravfisb, whelks, cockles, mussels, &c , being all ""com monly spoken of as shellfish, while centi pedes, scorpions, spiders, shrimps, myriopods, &c, are all slumped as "" insects,"" inextric able confusion is the only possible result. As illustrating such confusion, the lecturer retold the humorous story of a railway porfcer who found himself in charge of a tortoise. He knew the taiiff for ordinary animals, and his employer's classification of them, but this queer creature was something quite out of the way. "" Dogs,"" he said, ""is dogs, and cats is doge, and rabbits is dogs, but this ere crittur is a hinseck 1 "" Common sense forbids my attempting even to epitomise the array of strangely curious facts which the lecturer laid before his hearers. Facts, too, not by any means re lating solely to out-of-the-way or uncommon forms, but in the main to species of Crustacea which are quite common in our bays, rivers, ponds— aye, even in our water pipes, for we have Mr Thomson's assurance that very many of his experiments and observations were made upon specimens got in abundance from the domestic water-tap. In Dunedin, where we have so many temperance enthusiasts who would prevent the rest of the commu nity from enjoying a glass of beer if they could, we have, curiously enough, no party agitating for a clean water supply. Now and then a citizen may raise bis voice in protest and warning, but nothing comes of it. Only last summer I myself found thousands of small pond snails coming from a single tap in the city. In describing the anatomy of the lobster Mr Thomson very clearly demonstrated how tbe limbs in crustaceans are modified to sub serve many purposes basides walking and swimming. The tail (telson) is a powerful swimming paddle used for hasty retreat when danger threatens. We have all observed how violently the fresh-water crayfish jerks itself backwards when alarmed. When the lobster wishes to move forward it swims gently and smoothly by means of the fringed, paddle like swimmerets (also modified limbs) attached to the underside of the abdominal segments. When the lobster walks it does so by using its ordinary legs, but it always keeps its huge-clawed pair well in front ready for business. Next in order come the iaw parts. These exhibit very curious modifications, looked at merely as biting and chewing appliances. When, however, as the lecturer assured us, they are to be viewed as metamorphosed limbs, and in addition that the antenrjse, antennules ("" organs of touch, hearing, and perhaps of smell""), and even the eyes are alsb . modified limbs, our wonder is beyond expression. That a lobster should use its spare legs as substitutes for incisors and canines is most extraordinary, but that it should also "" carry its eyes upon its forearms "" is beyond my unlearned understanding. The eyes of crtuta cean are nearly all compound, but in some species simple eyes are found. Everyone has observed the stalked eyes of common shore crabs, white a qnite different arrange ment is to be seen in others, such as the water-fleas (Daphnia) and others, which have the eye imbedded in the external skeleton or shell. In the king -crab (limulus), an aberrant living form, the compound eyes extend round the outer rim of the horseshoe-shaped oarapace. It is only by actual study of the marvellous metamorpblc changes through which all crustaceans pass that this theory of eye-mounting cao be at all understood. Very few have such know ledge, and some who have it hold a different opinion. I remember that years ago Fritz Miiller expressed his dissent from it, though I could cot say where the passage ocoure now. At all events crabs use their eyes well. Some bury themselves in mud, and atiokiag their eyes out, watch for prey, upon which they pounce with their nipping claws ; some rock living species are hardly distinguishable from the colour of their haunts; others clothe themselves with shreds of seaweed which they cut for the purpose, looking very buman-like in their movements while doing so, it is said ; others have nauseous-tasting and spicule-armed sponges growing upon their shells, while upon others are to be seen growing masses of algae, which give the creatures the appearance of masses of sea weed in motion. The hearing organs of Crustacea, when they have any, are of a carious and interest ing kind. They are situated at the bate of the antennas, and consist of hollow spaces, within which are found a number of bristles pointing outwards. These bristles are con nected with nerve fibres which pass to the ganglionic brain. In one species examined by Mr Thomson small quartz grains were found in the ear cavity — a kind of primitive otoliths. When the creature moults, as it must do to grow, the ear cavity is uncovered and the otoliths are lost, but new ones are deliberately inserted by the crustacean in their place. In tjae above species the sand grainß are put in by means of the feet ; in another a supply is got when required by the creature pushing its bead into a bank of suit able material. In one species, discovered by Mr Thomson himself in Tasmania, the organs of heating are placed in the tail. So far as is known no similar species is found else where. "" Perhaps,"" said the lecturer, •' this curious animal may be in the habit of bury ing itself in its native mud and sticking out its tail to listen to whatever was going on around it 1 "" In no other class of animals is to be seen such a vast number of degenerate species ag in that of the Crustacea. In comparing the very high state of development attained by lead ing families 'with the utter degeneracy and degradation of other families of the Crus tacea, it is hardly possible to believe them related at all. Bat when brought before us with the masterly lucidity that Mr Thomson always brings to bear on his data we can no longer doubt it, and we can see that what equally tends to evolve high and complex conditions of organisation, and the reverse — loss of identity almost, with utter individual insignificance — is halit, good and bad. The crustacean that is only known as a loath some and shapeless parasite npon another animal's body might have been the peer of any had its ancestors not taken to base ways of living. Instead of becoming a mere sucker of stolen juices, limbless, eyeles*, almost org-tnless, ""a mere stomach and bag oE eggs,"" it might have owned as high a degree of evolution as any of its clas3. This, I- take it, was ths moral of Mr Thomson's discourse. Let us beware of the tendency to adopt settled moods of mind even more than of body. Let us seek to strive aye up ward, leaving our baser attributes beneath.",0,-0.680891945,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wire Te Kaahu attacked his wife, inflicted terrible wounds on her head and face, and threw her on a fire, after which he cleared out. The woman was found in an insensible state, and was removed to the hospital, where sho now lies in a very critical condition. Search is being made for Wire, but it is supposed that he has committed suicide. He was implicated in the murder of a woman at Waitobara in 1890, and was a well-known footballer. August 5. Pareti died in the hospital on Saturday. At the inquest a verdict of •' Wilful murder"" was returned against the husband. Wanqantji, August 6 Wire Kaihau Koroai, -the halfcaste charged with having murdered his wife at Hukatere, I near Patea, on Friday last, was arrested by the Waitotara Natives on Monday last, brought up at the Waverley Court this morning, and re manded fco Fatea on Friday next on a charge of ""wilful murder. He was accordingly put on the train for Wapganui, wLere he was to await his trial if committed. On the journey, on emerging from the Kai-iwi tunnel, the constable in charge saw that the prisoner had cut his throat with a batcher's sheath knife. He immediately took the weapon from him and went on to tha carriage platform to obtain the assistance of the guard. The man took advantage of bis absence to pull down and bound through the carriage window. The constable saw him but was too late to stop him. The prisoner was apparently not huit by the fall, and jumped up and ran back towards Eai-iwi. The constable went back from the next station and walked through to Eai-iwi, where he found the man outside the hotel. He took him in charge and brought him into the Wanganui Honpital to-night in a buggy, where the wound was stitched. So far as can be asoeitnined the man is likely to recover.",0,-0.690141252,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

88,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,15,IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.,"The exporcs for the past quarter again show a decline, though not to the same extent as in the previous quarter. For Jane quarter 181)4 they were £1,989,237, for the same quar ter of 1895 they were £1,859,813, a decline of £129,424. The two quarters o£ the year show as follow : — 1895. 1894. March quarter ... ,£},564,353 £4,001,799 June quarter ... 1,?59.813 1,989,237 Totals £5,424,166 £5,994,036 specie being excluded in each case, but as we showed in last return a good deal of this difference was due to earlier shipments of wool in December quarter 1894. There is however, a decrease in wool for the June quarter of £168,697 (£544,028— £713,725), but in weight the reduction is only 3,150,0001b which at 7d per 1b is £91,800. There is therefore a lower valuation which, If present prices are maintained in London, will be made up in realisation. The other decreases are: — Butter, £31,546 (£22.006 —£53 552) ; agricultural products, £17,949 (£95.629 - £113,578); andphormium, £9701 (£3547— £13,248). Oa the other hand, there are increases in gold, £34,318 (£250.867 — £216,549); timber, £15,639 (£41.503 — £25,864); kauri gum, £31.567 (£115,358— £83,791); frozen meat*, £26,960 (£423,046— £396,086); and tallow, £3681 (£82,107— £78.426). When the new com panies are at work, with English capital in tbe Auckland district tbe output of gold should go on increasing largely, and there are besides large enterprises being started on the West Coast and a considerable amount of activity in dredging in Otago. Timber is also looking np as well as kauri gam, and these industries are specially important as giving employment to a large number of men. The agricultural industry has by no means so cheerful an outlook, and the sbeepfarmer in the southern parts of the colony will unquestionably suffer severely from the unusually inclement winter through which we have been passing. Gold mining seems the one important industry capable of development by increased and well-directed enterprise, and we are glad to see this is becoming more fully recognised. It is fortunate for New Zealand that it is not entirely dependent on one or two pursuits, and when one fails we can turn to another with fair hopes of success. There does appear fair ground to believe that the wool market has turned the corner, but frozen meat and dairy produce do not present the same hopeful aspect. Turning to imports, the figures Bhow an apparently extraordinary deficiency for the quarter, those for this year being £1,073,121 as compared with £1,531,574 last year. On inquiry, however, we find that in the Jane quarter 1894 the imports of specie were £330,270, while in tbe same quarter this year they were only £37,950. This makes the comparison as follows, omitting specie : June quarter 1894 ,„ ... £1,201,304 Juno quarter 1895 ... ... 1,035,171 Deficiency £106,133 Even this is rather a eerious falling off, mark ing a reduced purchasing power at the rate of £660,000 for the year, but of course it may be made up by increased imports in tbe next quarter. It is a pity a footnote is not given in the quarterly returns showing the amount of specie imports, as is done with the exports. •",0,-0.707696423,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

324,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,11,PARLIAMENTARY GOSSIP.,"Occasional correspondents of the Cross furnish the following items of parliament ary gossip by telegram, dated 12th inst :- Wellinoton, Wednosday. Otago members aro in a "" swither."" They want to bo up and doincr, but what is to be exactly done they don't know. They aro moving about the lobbies, but ton-holing members, trying their political pulse, as it were, the ondoavour being to find out, if possible, what sort of political fabric would suit the respective persons they are trying to catch. What they want is to hit upon sorao form of Go vernment that would suit tho maleoon tents of tho House. At present tho ex treme North and South recognise no com mon basis. They aro as oil and wator, and want the alkali to turn them into good political soap. This is the mode :- Mr Macandrow is working, he has sont various of his followers out on a pvoßpcot ing tour to see if a way out of thoir diffi oulties can bo discovered. It is said thut they have already alienated from the Go vernment side Messrs Laruach and Bast ings. Thoso, along with Messrs Koid> Stout, and Hodgkinson.(tho last named' always a strong Provincinlist) ore tho principal men; but they are all of small calibre as compared with Mac. Mr Stafford seems to occupy a position of perfect repose. It is protty clear that ho considers there is no work for his hand to do just now, so ho leans back and looks on. Mr Filzherbet makes oven a bottor Speaker than Sir David Mnnro did, and that is saying a great doal. It appears that the reason why Mr Roes was sent to Auokland was to seo if a Sir George Grey man can be secured for tho Thames; if not ho will resign tho other seat. The Evening Argus to-night, in a lead ing article, says:—"" The great fight of the ft ssion is t8 commence on Tuesday next. I'his has been agreed to between the leaders on both sides, and as tho constitu tional policy of the Government is neces sarily very much interwoven with thoir financial policy, it has been further agreed that the Counties Bill shall be discussed at the same time, and the Financial Statement—in fact, that one discussion shallsuffice, and the Houso bo asked to view andjtopronounco upon thepolicy oftho Go vernment as a whole instead of piecemeal. The Counties Bill is expected to bo cir culated this evening. The policy of the Opposition will no doubt bo moulded in some of its details by tho provisions of this measure, but we are not far wrong in asserting that the loading idea of that policy has already been decided on, and that is—'One province for each island.' Mr Eeader Wood's confederated dominion of four provinces' was only a feeler, and, as the idea did nottake, the scheme has beon conveniently disavowed. Mr Mac andrew is, of course, the ruling mind in tho Opposition camp, and no doubt he is working very hard, and with a con siderable amount of success in consolidat ing and strengthening his party, which has boen broken up and weakened by Sir George Grey's indiscretion. Nominally, Mr Macandrew is assisted by acommittee of Olago members in his negotiation with members from other provincos j but he is the ruling spirit. In all probability, early in the debate next week, resolutions boldly slating the policy of • the Opposition —a policy of two provinces—will be brought down-if not by Mr Maoandrew, ' at his instigation, and there is reason to believe that supporters will be found in quarters little expected. Fully 17 Otago votes may be counted on for this scheme; and it is currently reported that Mr Mac andrew has been enabled to place the matter in such a light before the Canter bury members as to secure the adhesion of a considerable number of them, includ ing Messrs Stephens and Montgomery. That any Wellington man could be found to favour or support such a sohemo may appear incredible; yet wo aro assured, not only will there certainly bo one vote in its favour amongst our representatives, but that Mr Waterhouse will support tho scheme in the Upper Houso, and is en tirely in accord with Mr Macandrew in the matter. Mr Waterhouse has done many strange things iu the course of his political career, but if he acts this way in this matter ho will eclipse all his provious eccentricities. Auckland will by a largo majority of its representatives support this schema of Separation. We have not the slightest fear of the ultimate result, but at the same time we are prepared to see parties much moro evenly balanced next week than they appear to be now."" Tho Aw Zealand Times to-day shows, by a quotation from the orignal Parlia mentary Beports laid before the House this session, that Tawhiao expressed a wish to meet tho Native Minister as long ago as October, 1875, and frequently expressed his intention to the native chiefs and Mr It. 8. Bush, interpreter, Jiaglan, of sending an invitation to Sir Donald McLean and tbe Governor, through Te ffiheoro, thus showing that Sir George Grey's slatemont that tho meeting at Kaipiha was forced upon tho Kingites, and that tho invitation came from tho Go vernment, is utterly incorrect.

43,1896-11-09,OAM,Oamaru Mail,1,EDITORIAL NOTES AND COMMENTS.,"That our contemporary should come to therescue of Mr Sievwright is not in the smallest degree surprising; it might have caused some disappointment if bad not done so. But its .protege* may fairly complain that its advocacy is of negative value. Our complaint against Mr Siev wright was that he displayed unpardon able ignorance upon every branch of the financial question that he attempted to deal with, and that, as a consequence, he was guilty of wild misstatements. His journalistic champion admits that bur charge was fully justified, but treats the matter in a light and airy manner, as though it were really of no importance. Of course, we are fully aware that our contemporary does not set any value upon accuracy of statement, and that it views wild misstatements as a positive-virtue if they be made for the purpose of damag ing an opponent. Thus it endeavors to hide Mr Sievwright's transgressions be hind a wall of untruths with reference to the Government, Mr Duncan, and our selves. By disparaging others it tries to make Mr Sievwright appear a paragon of virtue, but the effort is a signal failure, for no one outside of a lunatic asylum is likely to pay any heed to the utterances of a paper which can class as ""trifling mistakes "" errors involving in the aggregate four millions of money. How Mr Siev wright exaggerated the growth of the public debt by two millions, how he then attempted to swell the sum total of the borrowing by saying that the million and a half raised to provide cheap money for settlers is not included in it, whereas it is in reality a part of it, how he blundered most egregiously when he attempted to make out that there is no necessity for borrowing in order to acquire land for the purpose of closer settlement, and how he attributed to the Government the imposi tion of Customs duties levied long years before any member of the Ministry got into office, are a few of the things we pointed out when dealing with Mr Siev wright's speech. These are some of the "" trifling mistakes"" to which our contem porary on behalf of Mr Sievwright pleads guilty. The admission is acceptable, be cause it most effectually disposes of Mr Sievwright's criticism of the Government's finance. The foundation upon which his criticism was constructed having been completely demolished, the whole struc ture falls to the ground a shapeless mass of ruins, and all the efforts of our con temporary to restore it to some sort of form are unavailing. As to the hints in dulged in by our contemporary with re ference to Mr Duncan having coquetted with the Prohibitionists, the public will probably be put in possession of the facts on Wednesday night, when Mr Duncan will meet the electors. In the meantime we may mention, however, that it is un derstood that both the Prohibitionists and Licensed Victuallers have interview ed Mr Duncan as to the attitude he will take upon the liquor question. To both parties Mr Duncan has, we believe, given the same plain answer. He will adhere to the course he has steadfastly pursued ever since the subject was brought to the front of political questions. In other words, he is prepared to give the people the power to settle the question on a national basis by a three-fifths majority, and to bring clubs under regulation. In this there is no trimming of sails to catch the favoring breeze, but a maintenance of a line of action to which Mr Duncan hae steadily adhered. The rest of our contemporary's references to the two candidates are really not worthy of notice. The electors of Oamaru are not likely to abandon Mr Duncan and progress for Mr Sievwright and stagnation. That is the issue before them. If they desire to see the work of settlement of the land vigorously con tinued, they will send to Parliament re presentative who can be implicitly relied upon to support the present Ministry, and they will not allow themselves to be diverted from their purpose by any loose talk of Ministerial financial prodigality. At anyrate they will demand that the charge of mismanagement of finance made against the Ministry shall be supported by something more tangible thaD the evi dence of the figures adduced by Mr Sievwright, admittedly in error to the extent of four millions. So far no proof that the Ministry have mismanaged the finances of the colony has, indeed, been submitted. All that has been given to the public is the bold assertion of an Op position unable to find a reasonable pre text for asking the country to dismiss the present Ministry from office.",0,-0.763318917,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/oamaru-mail/1896/11/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,61,MASSACRE IN CHINA.,"Shanghai, August 2. Reports have reached here of a great massacre of Christians at Kuching. Fooohow reports say that among tbe Ohristians massacred at Kuohing were five female missionaries, who were first outraged. The United States consul in Shanghai confirms the report, and alleges that the Chinese officials connived at the outrage. August 5. Four female English missionaries and one American were massacred at Kuching Many other foreigners, including children, irere killed or wounded. Fearful atrocities were committed on un fortunate missionaries at Kuohing. Tbe *nob set fire to the residence of Dr Stewart, who with his wife and one ohild perished In the burning building. Seven lady mis sionaries were butchered with spears and swords. Miss Godrington was seriously ""wounded, and several children badly hurt. The rising was inoit«d by the mandarins. The American missionaries escaped the massacre. The Eogluh were killed, includ ing Misses Marshal], GordoD, and Stewart, of the Zenana Society. Some of the ohildren had their eyes goug«d out. The Chinese have appointed a commission of inquiry, but M the commissioner \is the Prefect, who is himself implicated, the thing is a mockery. The victims of the Kucheng atrocity had no warding and were taken entirely by sur prise. The assassins were 50 members of a secret socioty, and it is believed this outbreak is part of a general plot against foreigners. The Eev. Mr Phillips, church missionary, escaped, but was forced to look on at the murder of bis co-workers, powerless to inter fere and unable to secure assistance. At Kucheng there was a scene of great carnage. The Misses Saunders, of Mel bourne, in attempting to escape, were hacked to pieces, and a thousand Chinese soldiers who witnessed the outrage took no steps to prevent it. The burning of the mission house occupied two hours. Some of the women wera horribly tortured before death ensued. Tbe United States mission house, near Hankow, was destroyed, but fortunately the occupants escaped without injury. -^ A meeting of foreign residents was held here, at which it was decided to request the various consuls to appeal to the European Powers, and ask them to demand reparation for the Kucheng outrage. Tbe Europeans in this city are appealing to the Powers for protection, and protest against tbe inadequate punishment inflicted fcr outrages on foreigners. August 6 Farther details of a horrible nature have been received from Kuchesg. Tbe ladies begged for their lives, offering to surrender their property and jewels, but the leader of the band ordered them to be killed. Nellie Saunders was hacked about by the ruffian's weapon and thrown, still alive, into Stewart's blazing house. Topsy Saunders and Miss Gordon were speared. Misses Blain and Newcombe were speared and thrown over a precipice. Miss Marshall's throat was cut. Four of Stewart's children were impaled and severely wounded, but apparently not killed. Although there were a thousand soldiers in Kucheng none were sent to the rescue until tbe massacre was completed and the mur derers bad decamped with the plunder. ■ The Chinese Government have ordered the mis creantß to be punished. There were 30 native teachers and 2000 members at the Eucheng station. Reports from Hankow state that the western provinces are in a disturbed and dangeroas condition. Chapels and hospitals have been destroyed, and foreigners are fleeing for their lives. Sydney, August 5. Mr Marsh, secretary of the Church of England Missionary Society, has received a cable from Archdeacon Wolfe at Foochow stating that Miss Gordon and the two Misses S&uaders, of Melbourne, Dr Stewart, wife, and son, and four other ladies were slaughtered at Kuching. Dr Stewart, who was a Fellow of Trinity College, vibited Australia and New Zealand some time ago in the interests of the mission, and founded a number cf missionary societies. August 6. The 'secretary of the Church Missionary Society has received a letter from Miss Gordon, one of the ladies killed at Kucheng, about the same time as the cable c»me an nouncing the massacre. The lady began by quoting the p*Blm ""In God I put my trust. I will not be afraid what man can do unto me."" She goes on to say :—"": — "" A number of people called Vegetarians have banded together to defy the man darin. One day when he caught four and pur, them in prison, the others surrounded his house and said they would pull it down and kill him if he did not release their com rades, so he had to release them. Not only ao, bnt he had to send his secretary to be beaten by their own hands. This happened at Kucheng city, quite close to us. They have persecuted Christians, and have threatened more than once to pull down chapels, bat the missionaries as yet have not been threatened at all, although they have ex pressed their hat>ed of us. Melbourne, August 6. Mrs Saunders states that her daughters ihould have be.en on their holidays at the time of their murder. They had intended returning home on furlough. The Kucheng mentioned as the scene of the massacre is not the city of Kucheng'or Lai-Gun, in the Gan-Hwuy province, as mentioned yesterday, but is the City <>f Kucheng in the southern coastal province of Fuh-Kien. Kucheng, of which the late Rev. R. W Stewart was in charge, is a station of the Church of EngUnd Mi-sionary Society. The China Inland Mis sion hare no stations iv this coastal province of Fu> Kien ♦ r J Wilkinson, local secretary of th** China Inland Mission, states that Gau-kiug in 'he centre of the province of G*u-hwuy, and that Kuching, also called Lai-Gau, is situate about 75 miles to the north of the centre. In the province there are 45 Bjiisionaries at work under the auspice 3of the China Inland Mission, 2+ of the number being women, 10 of whom are married. He thinks that the young womon who left Dunedin lately cani>«t posgiblj be among the unfortunates who have be«n killed. Mr John Wilkinson, local secretary of the China Inland Mission, has favoured us with the perusal of the annual letter for home, written by Mr R. W. Stewarfc, one of the victims o! the massacre. This latter, which wai commenced at Kucheng on March 6 and was finished on April 29, throws some light; on the rabies which have been received. Mr Stewart, after referring to the bright side of the past year, continued: — ""We have had some dark daya, too. Owing, doubblesj, to the Government being fully engaged with tha war, a sect known as the Vegetarians, but hitherto without influence or power, has suddenly sprung into vigorous life in this part of the country. They fin-t , came into prominence in August last, a month after the declaration of the war, and at a village called A- Deng- Bang, where an unusually large number of men were joining our ohurch, they attacked the con verts, beating some, pillaging the shop of another, and finally out down and carried off lOOdol worth of rice crops belonging to a lead ing convert; of the place. I a 1 ; once visited ear chief mandarin, who promised to. take the matter up without delay, but on sending out officers to investigate they were met by an armed mob, and, there being no soldiers nearer than Foochow, nothing could be done. I ought to say that on paper we have 100 soldiers attached to Kucheng, but the mandarin does without them, and pockets the pay. A month or so later, in another part of the district;, these Veg* tsrians, with whomarealliedone of the most dangerous of the secret societies, committed some offence, but not connected with our church, so heinous that the magistrate was compelled to seize three or four and imprison them."" Mr Stewart, after narrating how the imprisonment of these men was the sequel for a rising which eventuated in the mandarin being virtually brought to his knees in dis grace, says that frotn that day, when they learned their power, recruits crowded in ; all who are in trouble with their neighbours, through debt or lawsuit, flocked to the stan dard of the Vegetarians. "" I have ju3t learned,"" he states, •' that up to the present 3000 have been existed in the last half-year, mostly of tbe lowest orders, and at the present time the reins of government are practically in their hands. What the immediate futu>e will disclose no one can say. One most significant fact, as indicating the opinion of the better classes in the city, is, that they have subscribed some thousands of dollars to rebuild their city wall, and repair the gatea, and pub all in order to resist an attack. They are working with quite unwonted vigour. I asked some man the other day as we watched the building, why this great expense was. beiiig incurred, and got the answer, ' For fear of a, rebellion "" I asked, • Who would rebel ?' • The Vegetarians.' This was raid quite openly. Our house being out eide the city the rebuilding of the wall will not do much for v*, but we have a far better pro tection than that, 'He that ktepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep ! ' "" In a post script. Mr Stewart writes that the Veg«tarians rn<>B*ered in force and lo<ik«*d so threatening that the gateways of the city were walled up at night lo resist expected attacks at daylight, but tbe danger passed over, and peace with Japan having been deolared he thought no more interruption to the mission work was to ha apprehended.",0,-0.769515385,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
271,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,198,"""THE MASTER.""","The .evolution which has made Israel Zangwill a remarkable .and popular writer has apparently proceeded along lines not veiy dissimilar to those followed by the late Charles Dickens. Zangwill, like Dickens, first caught the public ear as a humorist. Having gained an assured position thereby, he took up his parable and showed the literary world that he was capable of doing deeper, truer, and more lasting work. His recently published book, "" Tha Master,"" would, I feel certain, have delighted the heart of Charles Dickens. Indeed — though utterly dissimilar in plot, scene, and construc tion — the book has a tendency to make the reader think of ""David Oopporfield,"" be cause of the life history covered by the story. Zangwill's hero, Matt Strang, is first intro duced to our notice as a sturdy, Nova- Scotian school lad, who has already felt that life has many roughnesses. Matt has the soul of an artist, and bis environment, hard though it is, has not the power to check this hereditary tendency. We are shown how the boy's spirit wrestled with his en vironment, and in the struggle gained that originality and insight which afterwards served him well. Mr Zangwill then takes us with his hero through all trie engrossing vicissitudes which he encounters between boyhood and middle age. Improved by the process we see him emerge from temptations a right-minded man, swayed by duty, and devoted to art. Mr Zangwill is unconventional himself, and he apparently scents danger in conven tionality. He works this theme cleverly in £he many fine chapters in "" The Master "" which are devoted to art and artists. For instance, he deplores the mannerisms, tbe imitations, the prettinesses and affectations bo frequently copied by artists, and shows that these things — which pass muster with many— are really orippling art. He rings this tocsin : "" Fight the good fight, artists all. If you have any originality which you feel is true, nourish it, polish it, and then show it to the world. It is a sin to enslave art."" "" The Master "" is a well-constructed story, and many of the characters are remarkable creations. Mr Zangwill, as is well known, has , a fine vein of humour, and in this inte resting book he gives us many humorous sur prises. He also discloses a facnlty for por traying vividly the scenes incidental to the story. "" The Master ""is a book calculated to interest both men and women, owing to the fact that it is endowed with that strenu ous vitality which is the outcome of much enthusiasm and much work on the author's part. Young New Zealandera who are blessed with the artistic temperament will find "" The Master "" profitable reading. Mr Zang will's next book will be looked for with much interest, owing to the remarkable advance he has made in "" The Master.""",0,-0.772521625,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,6,A TRIP TO THE SYDNEY STUD SHEEP SALES.,"I arrived at Sydney on Monday evening, the Ist of July, too Jate to attend the great show held by the New South Wales Sheeubreeders' Association which opened that day, bat made my way there early on Tuesday, and although j the arrangements were all that could be desired, my impression generally of the exhibits •was that the show itself was not the Buccees the association had anticipated ; indeed, in •ome of the classes in long-woolled sheep tbore was little or no competition. I do not think I need refer to merinos farther than that every one admitted the sheep shown were beautiful ppecimens of what the New South Wales ' breeder can produce, and a glance at the price lists of the sales shows money is not much ob ject where fashionable blood was offered. Truly it may be said Now South Wales is a merino colony, and although a few are experi menting by crossing, I don't think tbe splendid flocks of merinos of that colony will ever be replaced by long-woolled crossbreds. I heard no complaints as regards the judging at the choir. Of conrte I don't pretend to know any thing of the Australian merino, but in tbe case of th 4 loog-woolled sheep I thoroughly agreed with the judges' awards. . ', . The committee had spared no trouble or expense to make the flrat gathering a success, and treated the visitors from tbis colony (and' they were many) with miboanded libeiatity. If that society hold a show again next year, I hope tbis colony will. be better represented by our principal stud masters, and not allow the firiecs to be taken almost without competition, end oar beat breeders unrepresented thereat. Sut as I only intended referring to the sales I must leave the thon. Tbe sales proper commenced on Wednesday, 3rd July, with merioo sheep, at the stores of Blcfers Goldsbrougb, Mort, and Co. (Limittd), tbe sa.me firm continuing their pale the next day, but as tboy finished earJy in the afternoon the rest of the day was lost. Messrs Hill, Claik, and Co. followed on Friday, bat their merino catalogue, some 200 cheep only, kept my Melbourne friend, Mr Standford, a very abort time talking. The quality was ex'ra, and with eager buyers the sales closed almost at lunch time, and were not continued again till Monday, Bth, when Mr F. G. Weaver held his sale (tbe last of the meriDos), and as he was treated in a handsome way by the buyers bid ding him biiakly, the sates were finished by about half-past 2 o'clock ; so that practically the fit 6b week was occupied by- three firms in •elling 2690 merino sheep. Meanwhile the New Zealand sheep were all in store, and the ex penses, which I will presently show as high, were fast accumulating. ' I really think one or at most two days was all that should bave been taken up by tho selling agents for tbo dis posal of the merino rheep. If that had be»n done I am satisfied there would haTe been much more competition for tbe long- wool sheep — that is, if tbe soles had been continued and concluded, a* they ought to have been, all within one week. Afl it wss the squatters and their represen ' tativea got tired of the unnecessary delay and ■waste of t'me, and kno^tly left town for thair homes. Of course it does not follow that they were all buyers, but I was told more than once ' if they had known prices were to have ruled so low etveral who went home would have bought gome by way of experiment; at »11 eveuts, they would have been there to please them selves hid the fales been continued without a break from first to last. The long-wool sales were opened by Mr Maiden at the stores of Meu«rs Goldsbrough, Mprt, and Co., on Tuesday, 9th July, with a fairly PxteDsive catalogue or 1035, mos'ly fiom tb : s country, but it «as apparent from the first thr.t buyers were scarce, and pen after pen was bnecked down ab from jig to lg. Ju*t im*giue the Elderslie Liocolu and Romney two-too'h rams going at thoso prices. I feel sure had Mr jßekl been there he would much sooner have boiled them down. They wtre a fine levtl lot of flock rams in superb condition. Again, take such sheep as J. Greive 's Border- Leicett. r.a a*» £g (6 j{g ; W. Grey (Milbura), Bor der- Leicester*, £gto Jg ; J. M'Croistie, Border lieicetterg, \g ; and many other well-known breedeis at equally low prices. It was simply heartbreaking, to quote Mr Maiden's own words. What was to be done he did net know, at, of course, a great many of the sheep had been passed in unsold. I should mention that for Mr Mathew Holme s'u four special etude (three Lincolu, one Border-Leicester) there was good competition. They sold as follows :— 1 at 16g?, 1 at 20gs, 1 at 23g"", 1 Border-Le : ce*ter 9gs ; while the flock rams, a really nice lot, ■went ia a line et lg. A few Ta*mani»n sheop Trere also for the moat part parsed in ursold, and'were, 1 understand, sent home. The New ' Zealsudera - were so disgusted at the prices ■ offes ed ar.d rnling at the opening sales that a ' mte'iog was held that night to jcc if eomethiog could not be done by way of fixing a reserve. After tome discussion, it was resolved to sell at nothiug under lg : "" Bather boil them down snd take wbat we can get that way,"" said one of the Southhnd breeder!, "" than let the New ■ South Walt 8 breeders get the sheep at these prices."" But it was later oa found there were many obstacles in the way of doing this, and consequently tbis arrangf rnsnt fell through so far as the New Zealandets are concerned, but I may rceutton a great many of the sheep sold later on were taken by a well-known Sydney hoi!er. The second long- wool sale was held on Wed nesday, the 10th, by Messrs Pitt, Son, and Badgery. Tbe aale be ; ng conducted by the genial Mr Badgery, who, in a vigorous ppeecb, told his audience pretty plaialy they need not expect to see the New Zealand sbeepbreeders there any more with sheep for sale if they did not gif c something more than the luling prices. fie proceeded with his tale, and commenced operations on Mr J. B. Sutton's (of Thorubury) ■well-known Lincolns. They were indeed a grand lot, and although they sold fairly well, all things considered, I think I am correct in saying the warm-hearted Englishman was dis appainted, and in future he will be careful in ehippiog to Australia. His prices ranged from 2^gs to 3Jgs for fkek and sgs to 20gs for his etudf, arid the stad ewes averaged about sga. The New Zealand Land Company also sent a draft of 50 nice Lincolns. These went in a line to a Qaeenslander at 3gs. Following these were Mr Fred Sutton's 100 Lincoln ram», in cluding gome epccitl studs, which sold at 11 ga to 40gs — the top price of the sales; and his ' flock rams went in one line at 2js. L-ke all ' the Southland sheep they were in grand condi- ' tion, and, as the jolly auctioneer remarked, •bales of wool in themselves. I have, pSrhaps, said enough about tbese lots - of sheep, but I have done so to show that the • demand at all the sales was chiefly for Lin • coins. I focgot to say my friend Mr Menlovo ' Bent a email consignment of his well-known Lincoln!. They were, perhaps, hardly so well grown as I have seen them on previous occasions, but were in grand order and beauti fally wooUed. After a itrnggle they were col* the most should hsve taken four d»ys, extended from the 3rd to tfce 13th July. I was pleased in looking over the Now Zea land sheep to find they were a much more carefully selected lot than those gent up to last year's sales ; ,and, as regards condition, they were all that could be desired. I heard it several times uioationed that the cause of th« bad pr;c3s was becauae of the fear of flake in th^New Zea land sheep. Of course such a thing is unheard of here, and no one seemed to know what caused the rumour. I tbink the cbief causes of the low prices were : (1) Most of tbe men who are venturing to cross their flocks were well suj> plied last year, aud were nob ready to change the .blood ; (2) the ex ! eud< d drought that still pre vails in many of the chief grazing dis'ricts of both New South Wales and Queensland ; (3) the butcher 6of the city will give as much for a prime merioo wether, and prefer him to a half bred, and tbe merino lamb, if prime, commands as much as the halfbred for local vss. Some shippers from hero were inclined to bleme the salesmen. Well, to that I can only ' say they repeatedly wrote to New Zealand clients advising prospects as bad and not to ship anything but specially selected studs. At the last moment, however, the warning was unheeded, and large shipments were sent forward. Now, I would suggest that at future sales of New Zealand sheep in Sydney, the breeders here should cambine and ask that all tbe'r sheep be sold in one or two days at most It could easily be done without causing any inconveiiiencp to tbe selling agents, and charges for storage, &c, ""would tlius be reduced, as well as saviug time to everyone. I hope the Otago breeders will ccc fU to meet, say, during show wetk in Dunedin (next November), and discuss fully their position as shippers. Only fancy ! 9d a day storage on sheep, and some in the stores 8, 10, and 15 days, and then selling at 8s to 12b 6d each. It seems to roe unreasonable that this charge should be anything over Id to 2d a head. Then, ag&in, tho agents are liberal in the way of providing a lunch, at which all and sundry are invited. Such liberality 1 In each sc count sale we flud a charge made for same, bo that actually the New Zealand shipper, whether there or not, has to p*y from £1 to £3 10a for his lunch. I wonder what would be said if such a charge was made hero. Advertising, too, is a big item, and should be reduced considerably. The attention given to the sheep— for which we are too well cha-g.'d— was fairly satisfactory, bub in one store Bom» of the Southlandow had to provide outside, labour to tea the blieey pro perly fed .and watered. I ha\« not giv.n all the prices as obtuncd, knowing as I do the whole of the averages were cabled and published by you daily. The visitors to the Sydney gales wore liberally provided for. The associated agents gave a smoke concert in the Town Hall on Friday, sth July. It was a groftt eucccflfl, and it waa esti mated 1700 to 2000 people were present, I mostly all connected with the stock or wool trade ; a Bios crowd to preiidt over ; but ■well when the sheep are in Sydney. The j buyers (wbat there a^e) have you at their i mercy, and give just what they like. I think I. am well wMiio. tke mark when I say I don't think 10 of the many shippers to the last sales got actual expenses and outlay, to say ncthiDg for their sheep, which, to put it mildly, were worth lg to 2gs each here. Take the case of some I have seen account sales of : — By sa l e 50 two-tooth Leicester rams, atlOsfid £26 o 0 CHARGES. To freight, 7b 6d each £18 15 0 H Feed on fchip, 2s each. ... 5 0 0 ii Eutiy and driving , 0 7 6 ii Advertising and catalogues 12 8 ii Lunch 12 6 a Commission, 5 per cent. ... 16 3 n Ten days' storage, feed, &c, M 18 15 0 £10 8 9 Add to this value of slieep here — say, 2lseach 53 10 0 £93 18 9 Deduct gross proceeds of sale tvl ... 26 D 0 Actual loss on 50 slieep ... £72 13 9 I do not meau to infer that all the sheep were sold at 10 i 6d, but many were, and some at much less. Daring the 10 days occupied with tho brlcj the weather was simply perfect— nothing but sunshine ; but the poor New Zealanders were bo downhearted at; the cUsastrou* sale 3 | I fear they did not even know of tho cloudless sky, aud I am satisfied many who were there, like myself, will give the Sydney stud sales a wida berth in future. I may add that I visited the Homsbush Stock S-tleyardp, at which the meat salesmen procure their supplies for the city of Sydney. These yards are situated about 12 miles from town, and cover about 50 acres of land. They are tho property of tbe Sydney Corporation, and origiually cost £80,000. The revenue, however, from them is jo large that I was told they stand a clear asset, a; d hive been so for some time, wifch an annual income of £15,000 to £17,000 a yoar. A nice little outside asset this ! Tue yards are well looked after and in splendid order, with all the latest appoint ments, ko. Sales are held every Monday and Thursday, aud the average number of stock yarded weekly for the two sales is 60,000 to 70,000 fihfiep and lambs, and 5000 to 5250 cattlo. Yard dues are charged a 9 follows :—: — One penny a head on sheep and 6d a head on oat(l<\ The commission charged is 2£ per cent. ; 5s a tiuck fur unloading, the same toy loading, and men's time in attendance ; bo that the charges on the whole are higher than in New Zonlaml. faring the two d»ys I was present I never saw a single sheep or beast passed in unsold — all sold without reserve by auction. Prices ruled «s follow :— Prime bullocks, 9001b to 11001b anch, £5 to £5 15s ; good do, 7001b to 9001b, £3 15i to £♦ 15s ; useful do, 6001b to 7001b, £2 10s to £3 10s ; prime heifera, 6001b to 6001b, £3 6s to £4 16s ; priu« merino wethers, at 4-gs to *£gs. In Border-Leicesters Mr Badgery'a eloquence wae of no avail, as lob after lot was put up and passed in without a bid. The consignments treated this way included lots from such well-known breeders and prize-takers as Messrs W. Grey, B. Men- Jove, E. Greive, School of Agriculture (Christchurcb), and many others. Romneys were bat little better, only a few speci ally selected pens meeting favour. Mr A. R. Wallis (Southland) gob lOgs for bis champion ewe hoggets, and the same price for his prize ram hogget. Others of same lot were dull at 1£ to 2gs. Several lots were passed at auction, but sold afterwards privately, at prices ruinous to all concerned. The following morning at 10.30 sharp, Mr Standford (on behalf of Messrs Hill, Clark, and |Co.) opened the third day's proceedings. The catalogue of 2200, the largest offered during the series, was a varied one, representing as it did Victoria, Tasmania, and New Ze>land. I was much struck with, the quality of the sheep sent forward for sale by the ether colonies, and I am ready to admit in getting the sheep up for Bale they ara a long way ahead of breeders hero. Like all preceding sales, tbe demand was mostly for Lincoln Btuds only. Mr Standford worked hard, and as the afternoon wore on so disgutted was he at the limited at tendance and j oor bidding tbat the auctioneer announced he would adjourn the sale till the following morbing. Punctually to time again on Friday the sale started"", but prices were ngiin all in favour of buyer?, some of the New Zealand sheep going as low at 8s Id each. The sale concluded early in the afternoon, and was perhaps quite up to the avernge of any of the former on the whole. The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Com pany (in Conjunction with Messrs W*rden H. Graven and Son) followed, the sale being conducted by Mr Gravei, sen. The large catalogue was made up mostly by New Z»-a'and consignments, and included many of the most prominent breeders. Unfortunately the buyers were nlready sup plied, and it w«s therefore difficult to do business at almost any price. Mr Graves certainly did not spare himself iv trjing to persuade buyers to open then 1 hearts, but if they ever had any hearts on this occasion their pockuts were closed. In many instances the only response to the auctioneer was the voice of a well-known fellmonger and boiler, ""Qu»rler guinea."" The last lot in tho catalogue — five pure Lincoln rams — was knocked down on Saturday, July 13, at 9*. The sales, which at the ever-happy and plain-spoken president (Mr Badgery) was equal to the occasion. A more orderly lot of people with the pipe and bottle in front of them I venture to say could not be found. At aboub 11 o'clock the great organ peeled forth "" God Save the Queen,"" after which everyone went home well pleased with smoko, &c. On Mond»yjbllowing tbe New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company (Limited), in conjunction with Messrs Graves, gave their annual pastorslists' cjuvemzione, and in their usual hospitable ifianner invited all the New Zealonders. Mr Lawry ably presided, and gave a very instructive and interesting opening address. After refreshments had been handed round, Mr W. G. Abbots read a very interest ing, but I thought rather long, paper on the currency question as it affects Australia. Mr S. Lowe, of London, also gave a very fine address on the meat trade, and was listened to with wrapped altjnt'ou. lam sure his remarks were of much iuteresb to those engaged in the livo and dead stock trade, and he was warmly applauded on resuming his seat. Our fellow t jwnsman, Mr T. Brjdone, always willing to come to the front oh such occasions, was, I regret to say, too unwell to read tbe paper so ably prepared by him, ""Position and Prospects of the Meat Export Trade from a New Zealand Point of View."" I am sure all New Zealanders will find this a most interesting subject, and ably dealt with by Mr Brydone. -In Mr Brydone's unavoidable absence, the paper was read by Mr Lang, of Oamaru, who proved equal to the occasion, and sat down annid loud and prolonged applause. Messr* Davis, John ston, Graves, and others followed. The enter taiument was brought to a close about mid night, evoryone expressing appreciation of the promoters' kindness.

281,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,208,BEAUTIES OF AN ENGLISH JUNE.,"The soft June night is fullest of mys terious enchantment, syllabled by the cease less music of the river, at this dark hour just before the dawn. From this odorous meadow grass the harsh cry of the corncrake, übiqui tous and incessant, puzzles the ear. It is matched by the whirring reel-like note of the grasshopper warbling from tbe tangle of vegetation by tbe river's bank. The rustl ing reeds on the margin of the stream are loud with the hurried imitations of the tlre leßS sedgebird. Dimly distant, the dark outline of a copse is perceptible across the river. Thence the bootings of the brown wood owls startle the night. The crow of a wakeful pheasant, the occasional short bark of a more wakeful fox which is deeply in terested in the pheasant, come in staccato fashion between the conversational hootings oE the owls. Now and then, far up the stream, the faint quack *of a restless duck with tiny fiapperlings on her mind, or the croak of a nervous moorhen, is added to the voices of the night. Some> imes there is a brief interval of silence, broken only by tbe constant ripple of the water. The stars grow pale. This is tbe time when, beneath their glimmer, the Btrained eyes of the watcher may catch a glimpse of the king of the stream. Not a trout. No: not even that splendid three-pounder whicb, stately and sedate, swims up and down his own willow-shadowed reach of water, defiant alike to dry-fly artist and'eonsummato-minnow-spinner — madden ing each and all, and innocent basis of many a steep story and actual poignant expe rience. The true king of the stream is a mysterious creature, haughty, ex clusive, and secluded from the com mon eye : a true "" minion of the moon,"" a lover of the night side of nature, a tyrant and devastator, yet wily and wary enough to baffle his foes — tantalising them with glimpses of his footprints and ravages, but baffling all their craft and contemptuous of "" the hound's deep hate, the hunter's fire."" Only ocoa&ionaUy can the most persiwtent eye catch a glimpse of him. For here the otter — silent, sinuous, stealthy — to many as great a puzzle as when Piscator and ""Senator discussed the question as to whether he was beaßt or fish — is the true king of this stream. Not a constitutional monarch, he ia a despot, warring and warred against, but holding his own. "" Conqueror,"" certainly, but not as yet captive of the stream. Within the inaccessible holts beneath the rocky banks of the river he holds his sway, however fiercely the hounds en deavour to dislodge him. His tastes are wide. All fish are equally agreeable to his palate. It is said that eels, if plentiful enough, suffice ; but here, at any rate — per haps from their scarcity, perhaps from bis royal caprice — everyhing finned, from daintiest salmonidss to coarsest rank and file, at some time or another furnishes his meal. The traces here and there on the bank of the king of the stream himself and his victims -tell the tale to tbe practised eye. Barely, in deed, save when pressed, ere be finally eludes them, by the bounds, is he seen ; aud then fleeting, flying, fighting — not in his habit as he lives. Thus to see him — if seeing be the correct word— you must wait at this weird hour. But the summer night— the summer dawn — has compensations ; and to see the sunrise in England may be almost as interesting ac to see it in Switzerland, and much less hack neyed. The grey edge of th 6 dawn seems on the skirts of the daikness. It ia an eerie hour; and the voices of the night from field and woodland, from furred and fe.u her- d creatures, mingle mysteriously with the river's song — with an inexplicable somethirg which never would tinge them in sunlight. And now the darkness begins to scatter. The dew-laden meadows grow clearer ; the hedge rows, wreathed with honeysuckle and wild rose, are more palpable in tho dawoing light. Twitterings, chirpings, croonings come from the trees and bashes. The sunrise is at hand ; its first gleams will glitter upon the fish scales which here and there at his landing points mark where the king of the stream haa 'banqueted during the night. A myriad voices will presently salute the sun ; bat first and chief among them, from an ancient oak, always his favourite tree, the golden billed blackbird, at this hour more rapturouß than at any other, will be heard pouring out in fullest volume the purest song before snnrise that can fill the ear with harmony whose meaning can never be put into words. To hear the blackbird just before sunrise is a revelation which few indeed have experienced. As the light pours more and more radiantly to that glorious song over mead and stream, and all things assume their familiar aspect, one almost imagines that a droam only has pictured the shadowy doings of the monarch of the stream. — Realm.",0,-0.803967292,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,82,LAKE COUNTY.,"August 3.— lt would appear that ""Greater"" Britain would emulate the ""smalier"" in the matter of winter weather at auy rate It has been noted that our seasons follow pretty closely the general character of tbo^e of the Home countries, and this easontherp cau be no mUtake about it. We are experiencing wca'ler very much .like that we reud about in letter 3 from London about five months ago Frost and snow, and plenty of it, is the order of the day The cur rent wtek we had another heavy fall of dry tnow, which, besides coming to stay, is a sure sign of a low temperature, and this time it ha 1 ? not deceived us. It. has been intensely cold all the week, and though a change has come now, there is almost sure to be a relapse, for as a nil*) our winter does not break up till the middle of this month Tue Voice of the Snow.— lt has often been remarked that heavy snowstorms are preceded by loud and mysterious noises resembling thunder, but differcut from that accompanying electric ■storms. It is much more like the deep-mouthed growl of the earthquake with an undefinable loca tion of ita origiu or direction. No two men who heat- it can agive as to where it conies from or where it is at a'jy time of its c mlinuaucs. It saems to come from out of the bowels of Ihe earth, the air answering it as if assenting to the blowing hurly-burly, aud combined they fi.ll the listener with that gruesome dreal that is at once ■sweet and awe-itispiriug. Whatever the noises arc, or wherever they come from, there can be no mistake th it it is the premonition of the snow and the storm for either oae or the other or bjth invariably follow it. Fish Oh !— The annual sale of trout netting licenses of sections of our lakes or whole lake lets by public auction (Messrs O'Meara and Go., auctioneer.-'), at Queeustown, brought £77 odd. This is considerably lesi than last year, when .£11!) odd was realised, but it must be ex plained that som ) of the sections were held back from sale, and when these are brought up the total will piobably exceed that of last year. I) rath — Another old reiidaiit of Wakatipu has departed from the scene of hia labour, Mr G Crawford, of Gibb3town, Ksiwarau, died on San day last at the Arrow hospital. The deceased had been ailing about 18 months from sevaial causes, growing weaker as time wore on, and all hopes of a recovery had to be abandoned — in fact, death came as a relief to the sufferer, who leaves a widow and a son to mourn their loss. Statements Run to Sfei> —The papers hive been full of the bad weather and its effect upon st-ick and fcheep upon the hills especially.

It is safe to say tlr*t heavy as the losses may be in many case 3 the real death r«te of the sheep has been greatly overstate.!.

246,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,173,WELLINGTON WING WHISPERS,"August 3. Dear Pasquin,— There has been only one theatri cal event of the week, and that of such impor tance as to be worthy a ted underline as the event of the year— the production, for thefirsfc time on any stage, of the thrilling and romantic drama, ""The Land of the Moa,"" for which, both in 'script and stage management, Mr George Leitch is responsible ; and I may say right here that he has produced a play that will earn him praise th*t P.R. is not afraid to say will be worldwide, and I know that <the term is a big one, and so is this footstool. None who have seen Mr Leitch's play here can deny that its scenic effects are most novel and startling, some of the cloths (of which there are no less than 19 during the course of the five acts) being really beautiful, that representing Wellington being such an artistic piece of work that oue became absorbed so deeply in its study as to find it largely inter fering with one's following of the action of the drama. Fpr this latter reason— the charm of the stage setting — many who have attended the Opera House during the week have termed "" The Land of the Moa "" a "" panorama."" To *uch people, an' they be playgoers and not captious critics, I would sayj ""Go twice once to enjoy the sotting, a second time to watch the play."" I never had a craving for ye olde English, fad of attending ""first nights."" In any production that runs through a week my choice is the third night. The company is then in good working order, and, like an athletic team, have got into form and used each to the other's style and biz. In the case of the play now under notice, I went on Thursday (the season opened on Monday), and I found that everything was workiug as smoothly as a stage manager could wish or an audience desire. I had been told that the fir st aud second acts dragged heavily ; I found them very brisk. I had been told the play was wearisome ; I thoroughly enjoye.l myself from a quarter to 8 to within a few minutes of 11 — the time spent in the Opera House. Undoubtedly, the intention of the playwright was to make ""The Laiid of the Moa"" espec'ally strong in scenic effectiveness, and therein he has succeeded. It is one thing to create an effect upon paper— quite another thing to produce it upon the stage , yet this is what we have witnessed this week. The Knight of Drury Lane could not have conceived more btartling, weird, fantastic, sensa tional, novel, or unique sets than Sulphur Island and the Black Crater , the eruption of Tarawera ; the passing through the path of fire and the Devil's Blow Hole (into which the villain is cast by the avenging Waugarita) ; the earthquake and the rain of fire and ashes ; or the beautiful Pink Terraces— a most remarkable and beautiful set, with its reproduction of the once-noted and famous hot and cold baths, the live steam rising from the former lending an additional air of realism to an already vivid and massive scene. Should the play ever reach London — and I sincerely hope it may, —the sets I have named ■will surely antoni^h the people of the Big Village. To Mr Arthur Clint belongs the chief scenic credit . Messrs Renno and Slattery managed the mechanical. The scsnery in acts I aud II was of the "" pretty "" class ; that pertaining to acts 111, IV, and V being in stronger tones and full of character. The sets showing Maori life cannot fail to both entertain and instruct those who are unacquainted either by pencil or pen with Maoriland ; and if the small company of Natives now playing continue in the caste they will prove everywhere, as here, a strong feature of the production, for they enter into the drama with a vim which makes one remark that the Maori on the warpath in days of old must have been a fair (no, dark) demon, especially after warming up his feelings with a lively dose of his hari hari and haka— dances fearsome to behold in play, hair-raising when done in earnest, according to those who have been there and come away whole— terrible to think of by those who suffered the fatal consequences. Though the chief aim of ""The Land of the Moa "" be to present striking pictures of Maori laud, there is a definite plot in the play, and the principal characters portray, in the usual strong colours of melodr*tna, some types of humanity at one time psculiar to this land. You will see by the cast that there is only one white woman, Marvis Noble, whilst the wahines, young and other aged, take prominence. The Kura of Miss Fitzmaurice till, and the Wangarita of Miss Polly Emery are really capital presentments of the Maori woman, the latter lady playing the avenging female to the life, whilst pour Kura, the forsaken one who yet loves the betrayer, the scorned of all, even the audience (who like to see a woman scorned get even on the villain when she has the opportunity) — this character is a thankless one, but that does not £revent a piece of good acting. Miss Gladys eigh, though playing the heroine, has not much to do beyond looking nice, and that comes natural to her. The ""phat"" of the book has been piled on to the palate of Samson Noblem, and he is Mr George Leitch. The type was common in days of old, before the gold, old Sam being one of that class of whalers and South Sea rovers who were ready to do aDy little odd job from piracy to kid napping. There's hardiy a scene in the play which has not the presence of this sad Eea dog, and as he is built up of quaint expiessions on passing events and thing 3, he tickles the ears of the audience immensely. Mr Leitoh make 3 the mo t of his lively creation, which ia the life of the piece. Next in strength comes Capias Marks, the "" Black Angel,"" an out-and-out devil of the sea, capitally played by Mr Fred Leonard. I took a strong fancy to Mr Cyril Keightley's Roto, of tho Ngapuhi, the faithful lover of Kura, and who was the guardian spirit of the plot. Mr Hubert was a capital Scotch landlord of the Gorse and Heather Hotel. Mr James Cathcart, as Rewi, filled the cloak of chief aud prophet of the Ngatima.iiopotos to perfection, being both dignified and impressive, albeit the part is not a great one. Our Wellington boy, Tom M' , I beg pardon, Mr Harold Carr, was cast as an Eng lish tourist, the chum of the hero of the piece ; and a right hearty chum he inado. Sometimes I thiuk it would hive been butter If ho had been cast for the other fellow's part, sometimes I think nob ; for then the other fe'.low would not have had such a good chum. The other fellow was played by Mr Percy Brougb, who is lean enough for the pait he portrays-an aitUt. The stoiy of the play is easily told. Ktira, tho daughter of Rewi, meets, loves, weds, and goes to England with an adventurer called by the Maori? "" The Black Angel."" In England she is deserted, but, following up her betrayer, Kura finds him making love to au Englishwoman named Marvis Noblo, who is on her way out to Wellington to join her uncle, whom she had never previously met, but who turns out to be an old piratical associate of The Black Angel. Marvis loves and is bohved by a young touring artist, and when the latter tells old Sam Noblem of his desire to marry his niece, he finds strong opposition, the villain's claims for the maiden's hand appealing stronger than the hero's. Kura, as the wife of The Angel, puts in her claim, but ho repudiates the tie, abducts Marvis, and is chased by a British gunboat. Kura and Roto complicate and arrange matters by getting on board the yacht, tho former guiding the warship by secret signals, whilst Roto gets the helm and runs tho pursued craft ashore, where a groat fight takes place. The scene then shifts to Rotorua, where Rewi's tribo lay in wait for, and at last secure, the villain, who is handed over to his lover, Kura, to be put to death, but escapes only to fall intothe hands of another woman whose family ho has iDjured, and a strong scene ends i"" Wangarita tumbling The Black Angel into the Devil's Blow I Hole. The judgment and the avenging take place during the famous Tarawera eruption, through which all the chief characters, except the bad 'uni, come safely, and, after the time-honoured custom, live till they otherwise die.

I hear that Miss Gwen Davies and her husband, My Hastings, have decided to settle for some time ia this city, and if inducement offers the clever Welshwoman will instruct Miss, Master, and Mrs, or Mr (or the whole family) Wellingtons in voice-culture. Besides the training under signor Randeggar and Prof. Frederick Walker, Misit Gwen hao the great advantage of special coaching under her eldest sister, the renowne I contralto, Mrs Mary Davies. I wish the lady every success. Mention of Miss Davies reminds me that I met Mr Marcus, who had been managing her tour through the colony, on the Quay on Thursday, when he told me he had received a cable calling him at once across Tasman Sea to take up the management of the Evanseline Florence Com pany. Miss Florence is a native of Boston, U.S.A., and made her debut in London at St. James's Hall oa 11th May 1892, when she created a sensation. Since then she has sung exten sively at the principal concerts In London and the Uuited Kingdom, aud last year the created the soprano role in Dr Bridge* work ""The Cradle of Christ,"" at the Hereford Festival. She is said to have the phenomenal compass of three octaves, reaching to the altissimo A flat. Miss Florence is also said to claim attention by the purity and freshness of hor voice, the beauty of her mezzo-voce, and the entire absence of affectation in her style. Two prominont American musicians— Madame Breitschuck Marquart, harpist, and Professor J. Marquart, violinist— passed through Auckland the other day, Australia bound.

106,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,33,CARRIAGE OF PRODUCE.,"Melbourne, August 3. In the Assembly the Labour members raised the question of the new produce ex- 1 port contracts, and urged that the Govern- I ment should not entertain the tender of the ' F. and 0. Company while they continued to employ cheap black labour. The farmers are opposed to having the produce carried by blacks to the excluiion of whites. Tag Premier has promised to give the matter careful attention before tenders are accepted. The Government are advised by the Agent-general that no tenders have been received in London for the new frczan produce export contracts ; nor have any been received in Melbourne. The reason given is that a weekly service is required ia tho Bummer months, and that the P. and O. and Orient Companies, the only ones which can famish this, consider the con ditions in the contract unsatisfactory. Ihey have written to the Premier etating the terms they are willing to agiee to, and he is considering the matter. Land's Aberdeen line oan only furnish a fortnightly service. August 6. With reference to the non-receipt of ■tendera for the export contracts, Me Turner, the Premier, attributes the failure to the action of a shipping ring. A special meet ing of the Cabinet will bo held next week to consider the matter, and prompt steps will bo taken to secure for producers the relief which cheaper ocean carriage can alone afford. The present contracts with the steamship companies will not expire till next May, but the Piemier says producers may rest assured that before that time the Govern ment will have arranged more reasonable rates of freight. The Age, commenting on the matter, says there are good grounds for believing that if the companies carrying the mails will not reduce freights the subsidy will be withdrawn and transferred to come company prepared to make concessions. Possibly an inter colonial conference will bs called to consider the matter. New South Wales may not join in tho proposal, but South Australia and Victoria are at one on the subject. London, August 4. Shipping experts inform Mr Valentine that the cool storage space utilised last year for the conveyance of Australasian frozen meat and dairy produce, excepting poultry and rabbits, equalled 3,833,000 carcases of sheep, while the carrying capacity of the vessels engaged in the trade amounted to 6,500*000 carcases if two and a-half trips annually were reckoned on for each vessel. The experts assert that if meat and dairy producers unite for the better regulation of shipments and insist on all vessels being fitted with modern machinery reduced freights will soon follow. August 5. Shippers generally admit that a powerful ring exist?, and that the shipping companies are working under a mutual agreement. The excuse put forward for not tendering was that the conditions would require weekly boats involving 28 in five months. They also objected to the power given to dismiss a steamer empty at short notice. Messrs Nelson and other importers regret the re sult, which they attribute partly to the con ditions imposed, and also to shippers' fear of breaking up their business relations. Messrs Sfcimpson and Malthoose denounce the pre sent monopoly, and urge the colonies to co-operate. The latter auggette that the Government Bbou'.d give a subsidy. It is reported shippers consulted the mail companies before a deoislon was arrived at. Wellington, August 5.""

A public meeting called by Messrs Gillies, Clarke and Murray, M.P.C.s, was held in the Volunteer Hall, Milton, on the evening of Monday last. There was a large attendance, the hall being quite filled. Mr £ Stowart was called to the chair. Tiie Chairman stated that the meeting had been called by our representatives to explain as to the proceedings of the Council during last session, and seeing that such matters a* the Hundreds Regulation Act, the Southern Trunk Railway, Immigration «fee., had been di*cii3*ed. the meeting would no doubt feel deeply interested in the addresses they were abuut to listen to, and give the speakers a patient audience. He then called upon — Mr J. L. Gillies, -trho said, that when last he addressed Them in that hall, neither ho nor his colleagues ha 1 the least expectation that they would so soon be called upon to discms in session, the subjects of the Hun dreds Regulation BUI and the Southern Trunk liailway. He proposed to uive a Bhor «ketch of the proceedings of the session so that they might 'judge of the course of action j adopted by him and tiros be in a position to J express either their approval or dwapproval j of the same. He woa?d say, howev. r that, had he not wnscienciouslv believed that in | the course be wdopted, he had the fullest.; confidence and approval of his fellow electors he wo^ld at once have resigned into their hands the trust IfijSWhad reprsed in hitn. He -felt it was nl ways a difficult matter to get tiie public to take sufficient interest in the political 'questions «»f the day, and therefore it was Qic -more necessary for their repre sentatives to endeavor to deceminate infor mation whenever they could find an oppor tunity. Having previously had a distinct expression of the opinion of his constituents :as to the Hundreds l<egulati< n Bill, he fe't it his duty to them to do all that lay in his ~pcwer to prevent the Mine being brought into operation. He would briefly state what iad occurred with reference to the matter since he ""last addressed th< m. Afterthe pub lic had a nsideied the Bill, and realised the tendency of its provisions, a general desire -was expressed throughout the country that a special session should be called to consider it His Honor the Superintendent however, de clined to summon such a session, and the Executive agreed to wait till the ordinary meeting of Council ; the bringing of the Act into operation to he delayed in the meantime. Other matters, however, speedily came up, *ipon which- his Honor thought it necessary to have the mind of the Council, and the •special Session was called. In the course of his remarks he would refer t<> principles, not men, for although there had been wide dif ferences of oi >mi« »n upi »n some i f the questions there whs no occasion for tl ese taking the form of personal animosity and he could say. that so far as the carrying out ©f the Executive duties was concerned, he -and his Honor the Superintendent had never had a disagreeable or angry word. As to the Hundreds Regulation Bill, they were -all aware that the Council was partly com poeed of ihose who were also members of the House of Representatives, and it was ■only to be expected ihat they would support * measure which had been passed in that House This no doubt accounted for the large minority who supported the Bill in the -Council The mind of the public was not there fully represented, and this would be more clearly shown at next session, when there would be a full meeting, as it was -quite well known that two members were ah «ent who would have fully supported tht •Government. Another member who had spoken strongly against the Bill, turned round and voted with the Opposition ; but he would leave him to reconcile his conduct with his own conscience and his constituents They found parties were evenly balan ed ; they knew that if they went to a division the -votes of members would be equnl, and they also knew ihat the Speaker would give his casting vote with the Opposition.' Mr M'Lean, member <-f the Executive, had also strong objections to the Government rt solu tions as ten ling, in his opinion, t<« create an antagonism beiwetn the Assembly and i he Provincial Council. The Government, view ing the state of matters, saw it. was necessary to effect a compromise, and a meeting was held to consider what was lest to be done, and he frankly confessed that the compro mise which was ultimately effected was sug gested by himself. There was no alternative, either the Act n;ust be brought Into opera tion, or they must prevent it by a compro mise. His Honor in his prorogation speed) admitted that modifications might be made upon the Act ; but wtiat we wanted was to jirevent its being brought into operation, so that the whole question might be again brought up and discussed at next meeting of Council. As to the clause providing for the half of a Hundred being agricultural land, he agreed with Mr M'Lean to an alterati* n so as to carry oat the recommendations of the report of the Waste Lands Commission This showed that we had no desire in the matter but to do what was fair and right. We fixed the extent of agricultural land at one-third, aud he did not think this was too much, {neither did he believe any other one would think so. At all events we had to effect the compromise, or bring the Bill into ope ration ; we accepted the least of the two «vils. The extent of the Hundreds to be proclaimed was also altered from 15,000 t> 20,000 acres. Be had always considered 20]00U acres a large enough Hundred, as it was more ui:>.na»eable, and more serviceable for small pmchaseis than large Hundreds, as then stock did not get "" smothered "" aim-nsjst large mobs of cattle. He had also agreed to ■a cfause, giving the.runh'.lder a right to pnr -chase a block of 640 acres as a homestead. This had been advocated in 1864 or IBfis He had also agreed to giving compensation to the ruuholder of 2s 6d per acre in respect ■of the determination of his lease, and for ali fencing erected on the ground in accordance with the Fencing Ordinance, 1867. It was upheld by the commission appointed by the Assembly that certain compensation had been agreed or understood to be given ; he held that is a mistake, but still it is so held. It would, liowt ver, settle the matter, and without it arbitrators would be appointed, and in arbitrations the Government generally got the worst of it, besides having to pay the «osfe. By giving them right to purchase «40 acres they will execute all their improve ments upon that block, and in the event of their runs being declared into Hundreds they would settle down upon the 640 acres, .and bee me very good settlers. He con sidered it much fairer to give the runholder 4his block upon which to make his impro *e ments, than to leave matters as they were constituted by the bill, for he could then so ■pot his run with improvements as to pre vent iterer being purchased by any ont ■else- But as he. had said before the arrange ment was simply a matter of expediency— either compromise or bring the bill into operation. He (Air Gillies) next referred to the various negotiations which had been entered into with reference to the construc tion of the Southern Trunk Railway. On 4th June last, Mr Henry Driver on behalf of himself and several others, in order to aave an Ordinance, proposed to form a com pany for the purpose of carrying out the Railway. This was simply a means to an «nd- to provide against the Ordinance ex tending the time not being allowed, but it was distinctly understood that no action would be taken in the matter till it was ascertained whether or nut the Assembly •would pass and the Governor assent to the Ordinance extending the time. The cry was raised from all quarters that the Ordinance would not pass, and pressare was brought to bear upon the Government t<» force them iuto the contract with. Driver and Co The Extension Ordinance was sent to Wellington, and Mr M Lean went there specially to endeavor to get it passed. On 3rd July he was informed that his Excel lency would assent to it and telegraphed s< to Captain Fraser, then Depnty--upeiin ;*—.*«& . On 2ftth June we had <h» follow jnjj communication from Messrs Douglas Alderson and Co, *' Referring to the Ordinance passed l>y tire Provincial Council of Gtago during the last session,- we will thank you to advise us »s to the terms and conditi<4is upon which you are prepared to treat for the construction of the S»«ithern Trunk Railway"" On the 16'h August, we had the following from Mr A J. Smith : «• As the npHut of Mr J W. Williams, rail way contractor, of Melbourne. I begto«en qnire whether the Government is prepared to accept an offer for the construction of the Clutha Railway, and, if so, on what terms would the Government he prepared to se cure the contractor as to remuneration. _ We had thus more than one p»rty prepared to form the tail way. and as the Ordinance extending the time had been passed, there was thenno necessity for haste i» entering into arrangements wiih Driver and < V>. Ac cordingly, on the 31st July, the Deputy-Pn peiintendent wrote them as follows : — "" — I have the honor to acquaint you that the Southern Trunk Railway Guaranteed Interest Ordinances. N«>s. 1 and 2, of the last session of the Provincial Council, having been left to their operation by Bis Excellency tlieGo vernor, there is no immediate necessity for entering into any such preliminary arrange ments as were discussed between the Govern ment and the proposed Company whom you re| rest nt. I beg to thank you and the other gentlemen associated with you for the hear iy desire evinced by you to assist the Government in the matter in question, and to inform yon that the Government have decided shortly to call frr tenders for the construction of the line of railway in question, under the more favorable terms which, owing to the Ordi nances before referred to having been passed, thty axe now enabled to offer. Should you and the otler gentlemen associated with yon determine to tender for the construction of the line, any proposal you may make will re ceive the most favorable consideration at the hands of The Government : and riiould it hap pen that the Government are called upon to decide between your proposal and one equally favorahle, the preference will he given to yours."" It will thus be seen that the Govern ment lad no desire to net unjustly towards these gentlemen, but on the contrary that they were prepared to c.xc them a preference in the event of their proposal being equally f avoi able with others. 3M r Driver then wrote to his Honor the Superintendent upon the subject, and at his (the Superintendent's) request, the whole matter was allowed to rest till his return south. Upon his return on the 1-ith August he placed before the Exe cutive a memo in which the following occurs . '• What I would propose is. that the Govern ment hhould at once make up its mind as to the precise terms and conditions upon which it is willing to treat with any company for the construction of the Southern Trunk Railway, and that such terms he publicly an nounced in the Province or submitted to the p.-.rties with whom negotiations were at first entered upon — assuming that they are still disp> sed or are in a position to entertain such proposals. The first hing is t» deter mine the maximum amount of ca; ital upon which He are prepared to guarantee interest, wilh which view I think it would be desirable to obtain other professional opinion in addi tion to that of Mr Paterson. My opinion is that we should abandon the comparatively expeusive style of railway upon which the estimated cost has hitherto been based, and that we should go in for the narrow guage and light rail which have been found to work well H other countries similarly situated to ours."" Upon the 11th of September, the following minute was passed by the Kxeeu ti ye : — '• Ist. Ti.at Mr Paterson be instructed to reduce his plans and specifications to mret the estimate of L 375,000. 2nd. That the conditions on which the G-vnrnmei't are pr. pared to eiver int'> arrangements with parties willing to undertake the construc tion of the Railway be advertised in the leading papers in Melbourne, Sydney, and New Zealand for four months."" This did not meet the views of the Superinten dent and Mr Driver, and it was suggested lo instruct Mr Brunton, CE., to examine and report, upon Mr Paterson 's plans as his Honor had an idea that the work could he done on a cheaper scale than that of Mr Paterson. Accordingly the pi am were so submitted, and it was found that in some cases Mr Brunton's estimate was higher than Mr Paterson's. In his report Mr Biuuton says : — "" I have carefully perused and considered the conditions and provisions of agreement for tUe construction of this line, containing specification, shewing what description of material and workmanship would be required to be used in the con struction of the different works, and feel no hesitation in stating that a line, if carried out on the principle as laid down, could not be executed for the sum of four hundred thousand pounds (£400,00 ».) And with regard to a Company, or any large Con tractor working the line after construction if they had any practical experience in work ing lines with steep grades, especially in a country with so humid a climate as ours, they would think twice before engaging »n one with gradients of lin 50 ; and after thirty years experience on railways of every description, from practically level lines to those having gradients in them of 1 in 10, I strongly advise you, if it is possible, even at what you may consider a large additional outlay, to make 1 in 60 your steepest grade. I would have you increase the length of tun njlling l'£ chains, in order to reduce the gradients to lin 60. The guage of the hue to be 4 fert 8| inches ; rails, 60 1b per yard ; single line of road, my approximate esti mate for which, providing every appliance necessary for c< nducting the traffic, would be £358,800."" On 21st Oct. the Superintendent, submitted to the Executive a series of resolutions in which the following occurs :— ""2nd. Government to guaran tee interest at 8 per cent per annum (payable half-yearly for fifteen years) upon actual cost of railway— such cost to in lude land, stations, and r-olling-swKjk : that such cost shall n»t exceed L 350,000. Such interest to commence from the da«* ou which the first instalment for the construe- j tion of the line shall be lodged in the Pro vincial Treasury."" The Government, how ever, adhered to its former resolution, with the exception that the time to advertise for tenders be three months inste td of four. After the Government found that Mr Brunton's plans were in some cases more costly than Mr Paterson's they resolved to ask for the tenders upon the pUn of the latter. The terms and conditions were ready to be sent to Melbourne and Sydney before one word was said as to calling the Council together, and on Bth November were ready for bis Honor's signature. On that date the Secretary of Land and Works wrote his Honor :—"" Lithograph plans are being pre pared as fast as ihe means at the disposal of the Government will admit; the general terms and conditions for constructing and working 4fce line have been revised and modified, and are now only waiting your Honor's signature in order to publicly invite tenders, when those persons in the Province (to whom your Honor refers) will have an opportunity of tendering on an -equal footing with others."" In his Honor's reply on loth November he said,— ""Looking at all the circumstance* of the case I believe it will be well to «ul -mit the whole question to the Provincial Council, with which view I pro pose to convene a special session, to be held say in three weeks hence."" The whole idea of the Executive in . the matter was simply this— that being placed in more favor able circumstances, and having got more favorable terms by the extension of time, they had no right to give to Messrs Driver and Co. greater adysmfcages than any others who might be willing to undertake the work. Before the pouncil met tenders were called for both in Mel bourne pnd Sydney, but both the reports of Messrs Patursnn and Brim ton say that the work cannot be completed at a cost under L 400,0 .0. His Honor certainly sub mitted that the cost of the railway should V.c limited to L 2 o.' 00. Be (Mr GilliesV beJieved that, his Honor was as anxious as any member 'of the Ixecutive to have the railway started, but he was so beset by companies, engineers, aud others, that he did not krow whom to refuse. He (Mr Gillies), for one, was most anxious to see the railway set agoing ; and Mr Driver him self admitted that in order to facilitate the matter, he had agreed to give his services gratuitously in arranging as to the purchase of land &c in the districts through which, it was t..pass. He (Mr Gillies) had now only to refer to a matter of rather a personal nature - one in some degree pain fill both t<> himself and others ; but he did not shrink from it. as he had this assurance of his own conscience, that lie had acted the part he believed to be the best, for the Province, and time which tried all would tiy thar also ; he referred to the matter of the Provincial Treasurer ship. .His then colleague (Mr M'Lean) had said in the Council that he in tended going to England, and would have to resign the office. They repeatedly asked him when he would do so, but he did not know until two days previously that he was going with that mail. Neither he (Mr Gillies) nor bis colleagues could understand why he was si. long in making the intimation, and could not help thinking there was some purpose intended to be served by the delay. The forenoon of the day before the prorogation, he told Mr Heid he w..uld tender his resig nation that day. He (Mr Gillies) Heid and Duncan, then met, and, afier a long consul tation, he agreed to act as Treasurer. In con sequence, of the bonus offered for the estab lishment of a woollen manufactory, Mr Dun can intended to start one, and was to go to Melbourne for three months to see the work ing of the one there. In filling up all offices in connection with t-e Govern ment, it has hitherto been the practice for the Executive to make all the ar rangements, and the proclamation by the Superintendent has been looked up^n as a mere matter of form. The Executive met at 1 o'clock, when Mr Reid asked his Honor whether he had received Mr M' Lean's resig nation, to which he replied that he had not. The Council were met, and we went t-> the House, wherehe explained as to the Treasurer ship, and when he distinctly srateel that it was then only a proposed arrangement. A mem ber of the H'tise stated tint he knew the resignation had been received by his Honor, to which he replied. that then he was better informed upon thesiibjectthan the Executive. Previous to going to tue Council Hall he (Mr Gillies) had asked tlw Treasury Cierk to write out the letter of his appointment as Treasurer, so that it might be in readiness and to prevent any delay. Unfortunately the Clerk had misunderstood him, and pre sented the letter to his Honor for his signa ture. Next morning the Executive met his Honor, when lift complained of the appoint ment having been made -without his being t'coXHulied in the matter. We exp'ained that he appointment was not ma,d-j, only me nded, and that the Executive were not to blame for the mistake of the Cierk. It was necessary that no delay should occur, both in order to save the honorarium another day to the members, and also as there was a large sum of money laying in the Treasury which only, required the appointment of Treasurer La order to its being expended. The result of the interview was that his Honor asked Mr Reid to act as Treasurer for a few days til! after the holidays, and th'-n hewouid :I groe to his (Mr Gillies's) appointment to the office. They had a meeting after the holi days, when lie was appointed Treasurer, bur his Honor had taken up other around, arid refused to confirm it. The following corre spondence took place upon the subject : — "" Provincial Secretary's Office. "" Dunedin. 13 January, 1870. *< Sir, Tn reference to the appointment of Provincial Secretary and Treasurer, I do myself the honor to forward for your infor mation the enclosed extra st from the minutes of Executive Council of the 7th inst., I re-ret the unexpected and in my opinion unconstitutional course which his Honor has pursued in refusing to give effect to the resolution of the Executive, notwithstanding the manifestation of approval by the Provin cial Council on receiving the intimation tha' the office was to bo filled by you. • "" I have therefore to request that you will advise what courses you would recommend the Government to take in the pecttliar posi tion in which it is placed. . «• The members of the Executive having pressed you to accept ihe office of Treasurer, they feel that they should be guided by you as to the course which under the circum stances should be oursnel.

""Dunedin, 13th Jany , 1870 ! «. Sir, — I have the honor to acknowledge re ceipt of your favor of this date, enclosing extract minute of Executive meeting. After carefully weighing the whole circumstances, from a public and not personal point of view, 1 have come to the f < llowing conclusions, and I trust that you and the other members of the Kxecntive will concur with me. — Ist. Believing that the present Executive have the support, not only of the Provincial Coun cil, but of a very large majority of. the public; I feel it to be our duty to permit no consi deration of a merely personal nature to inters fere with owr standing firm and fast as their representative in the Executive Council until dismissed from office by his Honor the Su perintendent 2nd. Looking to the many instances of unconstitutional procedure, to use no stronger term, on the part of the Su perintendent from time to time, I consider it would be dangerous in the extreme to the best interests of the community to give hip Honor an opportunity of placing in power men after his own mind, to whose advice J believe his Honor's unconstitutional acts may often be attributable. 3rd. As Mr Duncan ha* signified to me his intention owing to the present critical state of affairs, to abandon his proposed establishment »f » woollen manufactory, and to devote hi* time more exclusively to Executive duties. I am strongly of opinion that, rather than afeandrn our position, or inconvenience the public by bringing matters to a dead lock, it is my duty, and I can sincerely say it is my hearty wish to withdraw any claims I may be supposed to have upon my colleagues owing to their having almost forced from me, I m «y say a promise to accept the position of Pro vincial Treasurer. I would therefore sug<*est that Mr Duncan be appointed to the office of Treasurer, and that I in the meantime re tain my seat in the Executive as an *x ojfficw member. I cannot refrain fi om placing on record the fact that owing to the line of con duct his Honor has seen fit to pursue in this matter, public business has been greatly hin dered. Several pul-lic works have been kept b;ick. and the consideration and framing of several very impoitant measures to be sub mitted to the Provincial Council at its next session have been greatly interfered with. There can We no doubt that a statement of the nature and scope of the measures to be •brought forward by the Government should be in the hands of the members of the Coun cil some time bef..re the commencement of the session. With reference to his Honor the Superintendent's ground of refusal to confirm my appointment as Provincial Trea surer, I can only say that I have been con nected with the formation of Executives un der different superintendents, and that it always was the invariable practice for the Executive to fill up the different offices and then simply to ask the Superintendent for mally to make and proclaim the several ap pointments In the present case the same course waa virtually followed, although, owing to the peculiar circumstances (Mr M'Lean's resignation not hiving been re ceived in timei the Superintendent's con cQrrence was asked in writing, instead of being done verbally as usual. I cannot help staring that his Honor's action in this mat ter has very much the sippearancn of ' strain ing at a ynat and swallowing a camel "" inas much as ""while blaming thj Executive for not consulting him in the selection of a Trea surer, he himself committed the much graver mistake of appointing and gazetting your self as Acting-Treasurer, without formally obtaining the concurrence of the Executive. "" I have the honor to be, "" Sir. "" Your obedt. servt. ""J..L. Gillies.

""Sir, T have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of yesterday's d ite, in which you express your determination, to withdraw all claim which you hare upon the consideration of your colleagues on account of their having urged upon you to accept the office of Provincial Secretary and Treasurer rather than they should abandon their posi tion as the responsible advisers of his Honor. or inconvenience the public business and retard the progress of the province by bring ing nutters to a "" d^ad lock.'"" """" After due consideration of the subject I a^ree with you i:» the decision you have arrived at, became undar the circumstances 1 do not think that we would be justified in resigning the trust so recently reposed in. u« by the Provincial Couucil, especially at a time when that body is not in session to express its approval or disappro/al of the Executive that would be selected to give effect to the votes and resolutions of the Council in the present important and critical juncture of affairs. It is satisfactory that Mr Duncan has in the public interest at considerable personal inconvenience agreed to accent the position of Provincial Secretary and Treasurer, and [ am convinced that his appointment to that office will c-nnmand the confidence of the Province and receive the approval of the Council. Seeing therefore that his Honor has so determinedly refused to confirm your appointment, I agree with yon that we would he consulting the interests of the province by submitting the name of Mr Duncan for his Honor's approval. I have only further to place on record my appreciation of the generous manner in which you have acted in agreeing to retain your position as an ex-officio member < >f the Government, a course to which no doubt you are prompted by a sense of public duty, one which is highly stratifying to your colleagues, and which I have no doubt will be duly appreciated by your constituents. ■ -' lam &c., Dor»Ai<D Reid, Acting Prov. Sec. and Treasurer. PS, I see no objection to this correspon dence being published. You may therefore use it as you think tit. J. L. Gillies, Esq., M.E.C. Such, then, (continued Mr Gillies) is the pre sent position of matters with reference to the Treasurership, and whatever might be his own opinions as to the fitness of either Mr Duncan or himself for the office, he believed that he and the other members of the Execu tive had acted from the best of motives in the whole matter, and each and all of them had determined to stick more closely to their duties then ever they had hitherto done. Mr Gillies sat down amidst applause. (We regret being obliged to hold over a, portion of our report, including Mr Clarke'i speech, till next week). The Chairman read the following letter from Mr Murray: ** Dunedin, 16th January, 1870. . "" To the Chairman of Public Meeting at "" Tokomairiro.

133,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,60,PRESENTATION AT MILTON.,"A number of Milton residents met at Me Francis Grant's hotel on Monday evening, and handed him a cheque to cover the amount o£ the fine and costs tbafc had been imposed upon him at the June sittings of the Magistrate's Court for An alleged breach of the Licensing Act in supplying liquor to a man while already in a state of intoxication, and to express their sympathy with him for that on the occasion referred to his license had been endorsed. Me Donald Reid, who acted as spokesman, said ha had bees deputed by the subscribers bo say a few words in connection with the conviction and endorsement. After referring to the particulars of (he case, the evidence adduced, and to the fact thab both Mr and Mrs Grant were in Duneclin, when the alleged offence took placp, Mr Reid said that the magistrate found that tho person supplied was already in a state of intoxication. With that erery one agreed ; ib was conclu sively proved by all the witnesses. The magig trabe then proceeded thus : "" The only question was as to whether the person in charge had an opportunity of noticing it. He was of opinion that she had ample opportunity for this, bub that the facb that he was an old customer and that ib would do him no harm had overweighed her judgment."" The only logical conclusion to be drawn from these remarks is, that the magistrate did nob believe Miss Frances Grant's evidence. The evidenca of individuals is frequently diste« garded in courts of justice, and in many cusea rightly so too. Ib is of daily occurrence and generally occasions little comment. In Miss Grant's c*ae, however, the matter is very dif ferent, and it cannot be Raid her friends are apathetic The list of subscribers I now hold in my hand contains, with bwo exceptions, the nam'S of 1 the oldest residents aud tradespeople of Milton — mm who. have known Miss Grant siuce tthe wan a child ; aud I have been requested to stale that they nob only believe that every word she gave in evidence was the truth and nothing but the truth, but that she is incapable of t«lliug a falsehood. I neod scarcely say that; I am pleased to make this statement, and that ifc contains my own sentiments with regard to your daughter. If the opinions of so many of those who have so long and favourably known Mi™ Granb are correct, as I believe they are, ib follows as a natural sequence that you should neither have been fined nor had your licsnse endorsed. The residents represented by this deputation conaider that .you have been very hardly dealb with. The monetary fine is of course of little moment, but by the endorsement of jour license they believe you have suffered an indignity for an act which neither you nor any rn^rabar of your family committed. To show their »ymp*thy they have subscribed and asked me to present to you the amount of the fine and costs. You are to accept ib as an assurance that, in their opinion at all eventi, the reputation of yonr daughter for ttuthfulnew and your own as a citizen and publican are in no way sollied by the verdict.^. Mr Grant heartily thanked Mr Reid and the sub -Bribers for their great kindness and their sympathy with him in the unfortunate aff *ir which led to the prosecution, the result of which took most people in the district, knowing the circumstances of the case, by surprise. He was extremely grateful for their sympathy, coming as it did from the principal residents in the town where he had lived for the pasb 32 years. It had always been his endeavour to keep hia house and business as quieb and as well conducted as possible. He regretted very much that Mrs Grant and him self were away from home at the time of tha occurrence. He wa9 sure that his daughtee did nob know that th? man she had supplied tha drink to was tha worse of drink. Reports had been published that M'Lcod was supplied with drink, which proved to bo utterly false, He again thanked the subscribers, and said h«j felt that he had many true friends around him, and was nob alone and deserted though a, publican.",0,-0.926086586,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Competition, although fairly animated, was of rather a partial nature, the home trade being the only section apparently eager to buy. Prices at first were rather irregular, for whereas the better descrip tions of greasy merino realised nearly last sales' values, there was a decided and well pronounced fall of from 5 to 7£ per cent, in the case of all heavy, faulty and Wftßty parcels. Subsequent sales have nob only confirmed this, but have also brought about a further decline in the inferior kinds of greasy, and all are now 6 to 10 per cent, cheaper than last time. Scoured merinos, owing to a good demand on the part of the home trade, have sold rela tively better than greasy, and while the lower, faulty kinds are mostly Id down, anything of merit is well supported at a decline of about id per lb. As regards crossbreds, very large quan tities of which have been brought forward, the only sorts which fairly maintain pre vious values are coarse, deep, lustrous growths, the supply of which is very limited. All other kinds ruled for the first few days at prices slightly under July rates, but have since still further lost ground, and must now be quoted 7£ to 10 per cent, lower, the finer grades showing the greatest decline. Scoureds also are mostly £d to Id per lb lower, the finer grades again suffering most. Slips mußb also be quoted about Jd per lb lower.

31,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,8,WAITAHUNA.,"(From our own correspondent.) On Sunday last this district -was visited by a flood, surpassed only by the great one of February, 1868. The rain began to fall about 7 a.m., end cnntinued almost without intermission till Monday night. The river attained it? highest level about 8 p.m., on Sunday, when it stood about four inches lower than on the occasion referred to. Long befoie this hour the houses on the Havelock township were, with two or three exceptions, deserted, and of several of them, little more than the ridge-poles could be discerned, amidst the wate*\ Part of the north-end of the bridge was carried away, and two large chasms worn in the embankment, which form the approaches. Mr Oudaille's house and store stood on an i; land, an inch or two above the water, while a strong current flowed on either side of it, making escape, had it been necessary to leave, almost impossible. Fortunately however the water did not rise so high as to force the inmates to leave the premises. A large quantity of mining tools, boxes, &c ,/were carried away, but the. v greater part were afterwards recovered fuither down the river. The damage done to mining property tttay be estimated at from L3OO to L 350, while that from the flood I have referred to was put down at the very least at ±1500. - This time the loss fell almost entirely on the miners on the Havelock Flat, while on the former occasion scarcely a claim in Waita huna escaped. Several of the settlers have been heavy losers, their crops and fences being damaged or swept away. A party of men are employed repairing the bridge, — i.e., filling in the gaps in the embankment with loose sand and gravel, snre to be swept out the next slight flood. This has been the third time in two years that the same thing has been done in the Bame useless manner, whereas had the bridge been lengthened a few feet at each end, not only would the repair be permanent, but an obstruction would be avoided which helps considerably, by stopping the water, to cauae floods.

90,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,17,MISCELLANEOUS.,"GRAFTING ORCHARD FItUIT TREES. The grafting season having again arrived, it may potsibly be of interest, and also to the profit of orchard owners, to remind them of the folly and waste of allowing young, vigorous, bat worthless trees to keep on cumbering the ground, when they might be made to produce good crops of excellent fruit in a few years by grafting them with select sorts. There are thousands of poor useless apple, pear, and plum trees (hat never bear a decent crop of fruit, and probably never will if permitted to go on as at present, and it is most decidedly to the interest of the owner that all such trees be made to do the duty they were intended for — viz., to bear good fruit and prove a profitable in vestment to the planter or bis heirs. Qrafting is such easy and simple work that any man of ordinary intelligence can soon pick up the knowledge of how to do it by watching a grafter at work. A HINT ABOUT ANNUALS. As the season for seed-sowing is approaching, it will be well to remind amateurs that annuals suffer more from overcrowding than from indifferent soil. One often goes into gardens, small ones especially, when the seedlings are' springing up, and finds a dozen crowded into a space to which one plant would have been suffi cient. In dealing with annuals, first prepare the ground well, making the surface moist and fine, and sow thinly, always thinning out severely, transplanting the seedlings to other parts of the garden. When this is dona the annuals spread out splendidly, covering a comparatively large surface of the soil, and making a glare of colour. A GOOD INSECTICIDE. Dissolve 81b of soft soap in 12 £ al of hot water. When cold add a gallon of tobacco liquor, Placa in a lub and dip the infested foliage therein, afterwards syringing with cold wattr. STONES BENEFICIAL TO SOILS. Never remove Btone3 from the soil unless Absolutely necessary, la light soils they help to conserve moisture and keep tbe soil cool in hot weather. In heavy soils they help to lighten the soil and render it poroun and warmer. FILTHY TOTS. Never allow pots in which plants are growing i to become coated externally with slime, filth, and lichen. Scrub them peirodic&lly with warm water. They will not ouly look more attractive to the eye, but alio enable the roofs to have access to the purifying and invigorating effects of fresh air. THE OLOIBB DE DIJON ROSE. It is not easy, says a Home pap<T, to select he best rose. Every ro.'e is beauiiful in some particular, but in no variety is such a delightful combination present as in Gloire de Dijon. It may be interesting to my readers to know that this splendid climbing rose was raised at Dijon, in France, by M J&cotot, who has given to the world many lovely roses. It occurred as a chance seedling, aud its parentage is there fore obscure, but the Bourbon variety, Madame Desprez, was probably one of its parents. We owe an eternal debt of gratitude to the great French rosarian. Gloire de Dijon is a good all- round rose — strong *ia growth, free blooming, pretty in colour, and gifted with a powerful perfume. It seldom gets "" miffy,"" and is responsible for m%ny a delightful cottage picture. The Dean of Rochester, president of the National Rose Society, declares that, "" If ever, for some heinous crime, I were miserably sen tenced for the rest of my life to possess but a single rose tree, I should desire to be supplied, on leaving the dock, with Gloire de Dijon."" COCKSCOMBS. These are tender annuals, of which the cockscomb Celosia cristata, with its near ally ; C pyramidalis, are the best kuown and most ! generally cultivated kinds. Both are useful decorative plants. The seed should be sown, in pant in spring, and placed on a hotbed where an intermediate temperature can *be kept up ; just cover the feed and shade tbe surface from the sun. When the plants appear, stand near the glass, and as soon as they are 3in high move them singly into 3in pots and drain moderately. Gjod turfy loam, to which is added one-sixth of rotten manure, some leaf mould, and a little sand, will grow them well. Keep close for a few days, and shade lightly from the sun ; this is necessary at all times in bright weather, for if the leaves are injured the appearance of the plants is spoilt. Care must be taken tbat they never want for water, as the leaves will also suffer from (hi) cause. Give air daily, and syringe in the afternoons at closing time. A night temperature of 60deg, with proportionately more heat in the day, will ' answer for them. When the soil is fairly filled with roots put them in their flowering pots ; Bin or lOin in diameter will be quite big enough. AURICULAS, PBIMROSES, AND POLYANTHUSES. Auriculas may be sown now, and a good packet of seed will give many beautiful varie ties. Sow thinly in gentle heat, and, when large enough, pinch out the plants in a bed of good soil made np in a somewhat shaded place. The finest varieties may be selected for the garden, and an edging of auriculas is very inte resting and pleasant, their rich perfume scent ing the garden. A moderately light soil and a good supply of water are necessary to get flue healthy tufty plants crowded with strong flower stems. Primroses and polyanthuses are sown at various times, usually when the seed is ripe. Seed sown now may be placed in a cold frame, and it is best to sow in a shallow pan. Prick out the seedlings when large enough and the weather is suitable into a prepared bsd in the open, sheltered and fairly shady. SOMETHING LIKE A VIOLET. In that land of flowers, California, Mr Car bone has, according to an American paper, succeeded by careful cultivation in growing a violet named the California, of which its purity of colour, delic*cy of fragrance, grace of form, and unusually large size place it easily in the lead of all flowers of its species, and in fact with many make it rank as the most beautiful of all flowers. This new violet has been in course of cultivation for three years, aud has now attained its most perfect form, colour, fragrance, and size. Each flower is sufficiently large to more than cover a silver dollar. Its colour is purple, and does n&t fade. The fragrance is intense, and the stems vary from lOin to 14in in length. AKALIA SIEBOLDI. This and the aspidistra, known also as the parlour pa'm, are certainly two of the best plants to choose for a room. One cannot be too particular in choosing plants for such a purpose, by reason of the dust and dirt, which cjver the foliage, choking up the pores. The aralia is readily known by its lobed, deep-green, leathery leaf, which it easily kept free from du»t by a sponge dipped in luke warm water. It will remain in good condition even months without re-pott'n#, and when the leave* gtt yellowish a little ro.'t- water will bring back the rich green colour again. BEGONIA SCHABFFIANA. This is a bold growing species, reaching a height of a yard or thereabouts, with stout, ; erect stems, and large bronzy green leaves veined with red The m^st prominent feature, bow ever, is the bksioraf, borne in large, derjsdy pscked clusters, and which, from their weight, ansume a drooping character. The individual blooms arc of a pale pink colour, while the sepals are, at their b*se, thickly clothed with reddish hairs, which become much less numerous towards the upper part. It is undoubtedly one of the very best begonias, beautiful ai many of them are, a great merit being that it will flower well on into tbe winter. Like the rest of its class, it is of easy culture, for cuttings strike readily enough, and seedlings can be raised easily. SOIL FOB WINDOW PLANTS. The soil iv which window plants is grown is an important element of culture. For racsb house-plants a rich, light soil is Mii table, such as may be easily made by a slight mixture df fine, fresh sand with god garden loam. In this, if good drainage is tecured, most plants will do well. Where, however, it can be obtained, a mixture of two parts of well-iotted turf and one part sharp sand is preferable. If there is a neighbouring greenhouse, it is easy to obtain such s,>il, but any sweet eatth which is not sodden, or is, by bec^miug so, allowed to gefc sour, will grow common plants well. It is a good plan to stir the' surface of the soil in the pots whenever it becomes hard ; this is specially bent floial to roses. The addition of a few bits of charcoal to the soil often increases the brilliancy of the flowers, and to some plants powdered bone imparts a more vigorous growth. To conclude, white plants may live, and often bloom, with little care and often in spite of negUct. They will repiy well-directed care by vigour of growth aud p-ofusion of bloom, while their wants are bub few. Attention to these ia essential to their health ; and in the house culture of plants, if th«y are worth growing at all, they are well worth the care which is neces j sary for successful culture.",0,-1.015369621,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,13,BLUE SPUR.,"(From Our Own Correspondent). (Unavoidably held over from last issue). According to the old adage ""it never rains but it pours.'' If the promoter of this sublime passage had had my experience, he would have added, '* especially at the Blue Spur."" We had a long time of dry ""weather up to I last week, when we had several heavy thunder storms. On New Year's day it was very fine, warm and sultry. The games and sports were first class, and were patronised by a respectable and orderly class of people. There was nothing to disturb the general harmony with the exception of a "" lad "" who had im bibed rather freely, and who hnd evidently got .blue moulded for want of a baiting. He seemed desirous although having had an abundance of ""John Barleycorn."" to tap a little claret, and which a, ft iend did for him to his heart's content. Save this little amus ing episode, a 1 went happy as a; marriage festival, the gentlemen vicing with the ladies in showing canvas Their hats were literally streaming as with flags and banners, and like ''John Chinafrian "" the higher the blood the longer the tail. On the same day (Mew Year's Day) the Wesleyan Sunday school children had their annual treat. Mr Manuel, the respected superintendent of the school, with the teachers and friends, took the chil dren to Carey's Park, near this township, where the juveniles and their teachers had a very enjoyable afternoon. On Sunday the rain fell in torrents ; brooks were converted into rivera ; all traffic and travelling was put a stop to. The Revd., Dr Copland, for the first tims since the church had *»• branch here, could not attempt to take the ford afc th<?foot of Gabriel's, 1 and many a time the Doctor has put in an appearance when men of heavier physique would have secumbed. The Wesleyaus were more for tunate. Their minister, the Revd. MrKeall, living on ""this side of the flood,"" had an opportunity of holding his service at the usual hour, and preached an excellent sermon to about a dozen devoted men Who braved the storm. For about three days we did not see the sun. The damage done to gardens and water-races must be something con siderable ; boxes wera carried down Gabriel's for a considerable distance. For several months, the tailings had. so filled up the bed of the old creek, that a large pool had formed at the head of the gully damiaring two or : three gardens, ani threatening total destruc- "" tion to several fine cottages and gardens. Two of these c<>ttau;e-ownere Mr ttobert Symes and Mr J. O'Leary, sought to recover com pensation for damage from the claim owners, but were nonsuited in the Warden's Court. The flood, however, works by a different law, and has, with the greatest consideration and generosity made for itself a deep channel, and taken itself to the Molyneux, giving the original proprietors possession agaiii of their gardens, and I daresay the cottagers in ques tion were very glad to see the "" Lake "" go without wishing for "" many happy returns"". This district has for some considerable time been well supplied with gospel ministrations, and we are glad to observe that another minister has been added to the supply, in the person of the Revd. Mr Menzies of the English Congregational (Independents) de nomination. We hear the Rovd. gentlemen has met with very great encouragement sinC^. he arrived in the district. It is said that ther v< * are a sufficient number belonging to this de--~J\. nomination in the district to warrant the attempt 1 eing made to form a church, and we hope Mr Menzies. will be rewarded for the amount of faith which he evinces in the "" Venture."" Mr Menzies preached at the Blue Spur last Sunday week, and we under stand that arrangements have been made to take the service alternately with the respected presbyterian minister, the Revd. Dr Copland who has preached here every alternate Sun day for nearly three years, and since the Revd Mr Martin left the district we have an open Sunday and an open house, which the school committee have very wisely allowed Mr Menzies to occnpy. We hear that Mr Nicholas, photographer, has met with decided success since he came up to the Spur, and has succeeded in making some remarkable "" takes "" which it is im passible to individualise.

411,1888-01-19,PATM,Patea Mail,18,“HAD”,"An amusing incident, which oc curred not a hundred miles frem the borders of Suapeka, has just been re ported, A bank clerk having received notice of removal, set to prepare him self for the journey. He had a lot of old clothes which he had worn out, and which, he wanted to get rid of in some way, so he made up a tidy par ed, put it in a black bag, and by the light of the moon wended his way to a river near by. Picking out a pretty deep spot, he tied the bundle to a brick and drojjped it. That same - night the village policeman was waited on by a young couple, who in formed him that whilst sitting on the hank of the river studying astronomy they noticed Mr Brown, of the Inter colonial Bank, steal quietly to the deep hole, take a young infant from his bag, and drown it with a heavy V stone tied to its neck. Here was a sensation I a right down first class case for a constable who hadn’t had one for fully six months ; so determined to make the best of it. Constable O Hooligan, obtaining assistance, pro ceeded with a grappling iron to the indicated. The news soon got abroad and, before many minutes, on the bank of the river stood a policeman, two parsons, three Chinamen, a jour nalist, a bank manager, a Salvationist, and seven sympathetic females. Aftei about an hour’s search, the iron hook got attached to a bundle, which was carefully drawn to the surface and deposited with, an air of victory, not unmixed with horror, on the bank. The work of investigation was com menced. “The heartless villains,’’ exclaimed a parson ; “ the wretches,” sobbed a female ; “ poor little angel,” articulated the Salvationist; ‘ ‘ welly wicked Eulopean,” rejoined a China man. In a minute the contents were laid out on the tussocks. They com prised a pair of seatless pants of the masher pattern, a couple of well-worn shirt fronts, an old pair of gusset boots, a few old socks, a crushed hat, and a thread worn swallow tail, in the pocket of which was found a lady’s pocket-handkerchief, a peppermint lolly, a fine toothed comb, and a pawn 0 ticket.

101,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,28,LONDON PRODUCE TRADE.,"INTERVIEW WITH MR HENRY REYNOLDS, OF AUCKLAND. By Drover. Taking advantage of Mr Reynokls's presence in Dunediu I waited upon him on Tuesday with a view (o getting from him some particulars of his vhit to the Home country. In answer to a question, Mr Reynolds said : I It ft the colony lasb Oc'ober, and arrived in London in the end of Novetnb.-r, when New Zealand produce was be ginnir.g to arrive, the lonic (by which I travelled) taking the first consignments. I found whea I got Home that the committee of leading houses, which I had inaugurated for bhe regulation of f rices, had fallen through, owing to the action of the Vid o ian Dairyoien'6 Asso ciation. I consider tbn very unfortunate, as these gentlemen had no axe to grind, and could, I , think, have regulated prices so that they would nob have bee n so disastrous aY they have proved. As it was, the-bujers had everything their own way, a large number of tha gelling brokers only competing with one av.o'hsr as to who should ccII cheapest, causing little else than * panic on the market. Did heavy supplies justify this hasty selling ? No, I think not, and I am of opinion— and this is shared by some of the leading merchants — that the quantity of butter sold could have easily been disposed of at much higher prices undtr proper regulation. Don'c yow think that our prod ace gies for distribution into tco msuy h&nis ? Certainly. It is the unnecessary competition among so many sellers tbab ttslls so heavily against us, and threatens t> ruin the industry. Have ycu any idea how this drawback can be remedied ? In my opinion the only way in which the difficulty can be Btlved is by limiting, *s far as possible, the number of consignees or agents and having regular aud well-organised auct'oa Sfcles. Would the agents place a reterve on the pro duce tlui offered? No ; to make it a complete success it musb be offered without teseive. Might not a ring ot buyers operate so as to keep prices low ia their qtu interests ? No, as it would be well advertised and offered in em ill lots to suit all classes of re tailers' snd small distributing merchants, and New Zealand chcere aud bu'ter are now too well kuovrn for eny such ring to be able to operate. After a time these aue'ions might be «xtende:l to oth.-r towna, buyers iron any of th< m miatitime instructing their agents in Lon don to biiy as tht jT desire.' ' Would all colonial produce be sold in this way ? Not nec.SEarily at firs'-, the idea being to asc<v!a ; u the actual mat ket > value of the goods cash week. Travellers and agents would then be able to sell all over the United Kirgdom on the baii s of these rales so ascertained. Would each firm of ontigoees have an auc'ion sale at thsir own stores ? Yes, and do their own selling. Supposing we in New Zealand coufi.ie ourselves to three or fonr of the best firms. They would agree as to> their times of gelling so as not to clath with ona another. What leads ycu to balieve that this plan would be an improvement on present arracge mects ? It wosld prevent the present ruinous compe tition amoDg sellers, and would stop buyers going from one house to another making use of quotations to txtoib a lower rate from the next man, a practice which has bsen carried ou very largely, causing needless lowering of prices and costing producsrs iv the colony a vast sum of money. Have you talked this matter over with any of those interested in the colonies ? Ye*, a large number, and especially with Me ""Vagg, of the Melbourne Chilled Butter Com pany, who has been in London during the whole of the p&st season. He is a very prac tical m»n, and his interests are purely colonial. Iq his opinion the time is now ripe for starting this plan of handling our pioiuca, and he is convinced that only uuder such a plan will we secure full and fair market rates for our pro duce. He strongly advises his company and friends to give this auctiGn"" scheme a thorough trial. With him I interviewed in London mer chants and bankers, who expressed themselves as in entire sympathy with this ncheme, and prepared to support it as the solution of » difficult problem. Will there be any extra espenae in telling ender this method ? No ; the charges will be the same as hitherto. What are yonr ideas as to the pi'Jspecta of the ma-ket in the coming season ? Taere sre some points in favour of a slight improvement in prices, or, at leant, of no further drop in the already low ra'ige of prices. (1) The market this year will u^t *t the open ing be handicapped by heavy stocks of stored butter, as it was lasb season. (2) Ths hw pricei ruling last season have introduced our produce to m»ny markets that otherwise would not have teen reached, owing to conservatism and prejudio"", and now ths demand from those sources vrill be continue-], and should bo a hflf>. Manchester and Liverpool — the former ! particularly — were very conservative, and more colonial produce has gone there this year than duting the previous 10 years put together. (3) These low prices have displaced to a great I extent margarine and mixtures, and a tasto for pare butter has beeu cultivated. This also will help vi, I tbiuk. (4) Trade iv BogTand is better, and there is a prospect that the working elates wi'l be more fully employed, which means increased consumption and demand. I don't want to mislead people, but I think we have at least touched bottom, and am not wibh ou l » hope of improvement— hope which would be stronger but for tho fact that our greatest com- - petitorp, the Danes and Swedes,- have deter mined to con'iuuo the struggle for at least another season, although at heavy cost and loss. Ib is therefore the more needful that colonial productiM should sbfuid ttnulder bo shoulder, and if they will only do so I am convinced thab tbe British market will be secured for our produce, and that most of our competitors, who work vow under great disadvantage*, will be compelled to retire from the field, convinced that nature has placed m in a position to produce in a way that they cannot do. What is your opinion on the prospect 3 for cheese ? "" Thousands of pounds are annually lost to the colony by the cheese lauding too etroDg for the British consumer. It is admitted that the bulk of tha cheese is of good quality, well made, and very suitable, bub for tho Btrocg flavour which is almost universal, and prevents a nuaibar of wou'.d-be buyers from touching it, they gciug straight for Canadian eo'.ely because of its m'lduefs. A good deal has yet to be done in improved methods of steamer carriage as wall as of make I thii.k the maikeb will be steady, but at a low range of prices. j What <3o you think of the proposal ta Bend a j xnau Home to inspect our produce, and other wise see and report ou the trade generally ? My opiniou has not changed in t'aab re*peeb, aud I havo always strongly"" advocated this course. It must, however, ba understood thab whoever is appointed must be a thoroughly competent man, possessing both bus-iaeas ability and a thorough knowledgeof fae tr*dß, with a grasp of the colonial end of the busiues-i and of the various quali J ics of our cheese and batter. I have often spoken to raercbant3 at HGme on this subjret, and from whab they say I am sure they would we'eorae such a man, as he would act as a medium in a'l cases of dis pute and could give an impartial report and valuable and rel'ab!e information, leading to grc»t improvements in the manufacture. Did you see any thing of the Goihic's chilled beaf, and what tlo you tbiuk of tte proßtesfcs of thab trade ? Yes, I was at Smibbfisld on the two mornings on which it was offered for tale, and undoubtedly ib was a pronounced success. Toe msat was as dry and fresh-looking as if only killed the pre vious day. The best proof I can give es bo the condition is thab one lnrge Wetb End butcher returned for bis fourth purchase during tho time of my last vitib, aud iv each instance had to pay a higher rate, showing thab the beef wbea cut up gave satisfaction. This man usually dealt largely in American chUled beef. I am perfectly sitiefiid thab this opens out almost a naw colonial industry, *ndthat such beef can bs sold ab remunerative rites to the farmer, and should lead to more care bsing taken in the rearing of calves in dairying districts, as I look for beet to main tain its price. Obher fcteamers are now being fitted with the thermostat with a view to in creasing the trade. Mr Reynolds further said : With regard to the auction sales that have already taken place, they must nob be taken as a criterion of whab the auction sales would be, as they consisted mainly of long stored and strong cheese of poor quality, and any good cheese amongst tho lots suffered through the bad company in which it was placed.",0,-1.022798011,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accused was chnrged (1) with being drunk and disorderly, (2) with committing an inchoate offence peculiar to the Courts of thia district, but which in plain English meant "" fighting in the streets."" I interjected nothing. I left interruption to the policeman. I did, however, say in my opening that if my instrnctions were to be relied on the witness had been guilty of atrocious perjury. His Worship said that perjury was a matter of everyday occurrence before him, and he would not allow such remarks as mine to be made in his Court I Now, the best commentary on yonr narrative and my statement is the fact that Mr Tnrnbull dismissed the charge oi -Isorderly conduct, convicting only of -drunkenness, as aoyone can ascertain by ■enquiry of the Clerk of the Court. He -could scarcely havo done otherwise, as the evidence of tho constable was entirely tmcorroborated, and the accused, who is a smart, well educated man, his -witness— Blake, a man of extremely gond character and manners— and another wit ness directly contradicted the constable's statement. Unfortunately, in the 9ccond case, the two witnesses for the defence bad left the Court, thinking they were finished with, and the conviction went, in a manner, by default. As it was absurd to suppose that the matter could he allowed to rest there. I made farther in quiries na to the truth of my client's state ment, with the result that I have felt it my duty to lay the whole affair before the Ministers of Justice and Defence.

If bs bos been informed to the contrary by those who succeeded in getting the esse mist-sported in two papers, by the suppression of Fan-ell's name and the substitution of "" Worrall "" therefor, their agreement to suppress the name and to deliberately state a falsehood {ie, that a man named Worrall assaulted Murnane) shonld teach him that he is not prudent in depending npon any statement from that quarter. As to the second informa tion being for an ""inchoate offence,"" the facta are very simple. Murnane was thrust to tho ground, and subsequently, as sworn to by himself, was struck in tbe mouth by Farrell. The latter was charged, not with fighting in tho streets, but with threatening behavior calculated to cause a breach of tho peace. He was convicted of that offence, and fined the small amount of £1 only, a punishment far irom commensurate with tho offence. The maeistrate did not, it is (rue, convict on the latter half of tho first information (thatdefendant was drunk and disorderly), but fined bim for being drunk only. Why that was done Is hard to say, but the fact formed one of the reasons why we com wented upon the case. As to the two witnesses referred to, they were two of Farrell's three companions.— Ed.

392,1854-07-08,OW,Otago Witness,5,SOIREE.,"On Wednesday the 28th ult. a Soiree was held m the School-Room, Dunedin*, at which about 220 per sons were present. At 6| o'clock his Honor the Superintendent took the Chair, and was most en thusiastically received. After tea the Chairman called upon the Rev. Wm. Bannerman, who at some length most ably addressed the meeting on the all-important subject of Education. He rejoiced to perceive that the'question was one which was occu pying public attention, and to which public attention had been lately directed ; he urged the necessity of each individual present furthering the object to the utmost in their power, and in this way prove that they had made a good application of his remarks. The Chairman then called upon the Rev. Wm. Will, and Messrs. Thos. Bell and John M'Glashan, to address the meeting, all of whom delivered most excellent addresses, which, if we are to judge from the applause they received, gave general satisfac tion. We regret that our space will not even admit of our giving the outlines of the speeches. The Chairman expressed his regret that the late ness of the hour prevented him from calling upon the Rev. Thomas Burns and Mr M'Dowall to ad dress them. The meeting broke up at 10 o'clock, all parties being highly gratified. Much credit is due to the Committee of the Mechanics' Institution, under whose auspices the arrangements were con ducted, and who have most magnanimously devoted ; the receipts, which (after deducting the expenses) amount to £9 ss. 4d., to the cause of Education.

80,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,7,THE LONGWOOL SHEEP SALE FIASCO IN SYDNEY.,"TO THE EDITOR. Sir, — As an old New Zcalander, and one still feeling a great interest in everything that concerns the welfare of th»t colony, I followed closely tho procsedings of the )at« sheep sales from first to last, and beg the favour of a little space in your valuable journal to record my impressions for tbe information of tbo=e who were not here, bat who have a direct interest in the matter. The Belling of New Zealand slud sheep ia Sydney was started three years ago. The first year's sales wera very satisfactory indeed. Good prices were realised, and buyers were thoroughly satisfied with their purchases. The following year the number of sheep sent over was largely increased, the number of Belling agents was greater, and the quality o! the sheep was by no means so uniformly good. Notwithstanding this, however, all the shsep found buyers at from fairly good to highly satis factory/ pricas. Tais year the taleß can only be described as a fiasco, and my 6bject in Writing is to endeavour to set forth the conditions which appear to me 'to have made them bo. They are as fo'lows :—: — Ist. There were far too many sheep sect over, say about 851/0 longwools (about 1000 of which came from Tasmania). 2nd, The placing of the sheep in the hands of too many agents. 3rd. The incomprehensible manner in which time was waited, which must have resulted in nuny country buyers being obliged to return home before the sales were anything like con cluded. 4th. The dry season being experienced hero in many districts amounting to a drought As to tho number of sheep and the number of agents, one has of course no imam of iog upon what advice the New Zealanders acted in sending over such an eaormoiu num ber of ehcep ; but one is tempted to fear, see ing the competition for business that must exist where so many different agents are concerned, that out of thi* multitude of counsellors there his not coma wisdom, and it seoms to me that in their own interests the NevvZeaHnd brooders should discontinue the practice of dividing their | consignments ink) the hands of so many sales men. When this is done one agent is apt . rather to endanvour to make points against his rival than to study the interests of vendors at a whole, and tbe buying competition is con siderably weakened by the sheep being distri buted in a number of hands and places instead of being concentrated at one point. What I would recommend is that by some proc(B 3 or other New Zealand breeders should select an agent here — the best they can get— and concentrate the whole of th»-ir consign ments in bis bands. Some system should also be established in your colony by which the advice of the sgo&t at this end as to the num ber and description of sheep that the Sydney' market cun absorb at remunerative rates can be given fall effect to. .The solution of the whole difficulty is "" Combine ! combine ! com bine ! "" Now as to the ex'raordinary waste of time in the conduct of the sales. I observed by the various catalogues that the following order of sale 3 had been arranged by the auctioneers, and on making inquiries I found this had been arranged by the very proper system of drawing lots : — ORDER OF SALES. MERINOS. Goldsbrough, Mort, and Co. (Limited). Hill, Clark, and Co., in conjunction with Powers, Rutherford, and Co. F. G. Weaver. I LONGWOOLS. Gold'brough, Mort, and Co. (Limited). Pitt, Son, and Badgery (Limited). Harrison, Jones, and Devlin (Limited). Hill, Clark, and Co., in conjunction with Powers. Rutherford, and Co. W. 11. Graves and Son, in conjunction with the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company (Limited), The first firm on the list — Messrs Golds brough, Mort, and Co. — commenced their sale of merinos on Wednesday morning, 3rd July, at 10 p.m., selling throughout the entire day, resuming on Thursday morning, and conclud ing their sale about 12.45 p.m. Ooe would naturally have supposed that the auctioneer next on the lUt would have proceeded with his gale, and sold throughout that afternoon, but as a mutter of fact nothing more was done that day, Messrs Hill, Clark, and Co. not com mencing their merino sale till Friday morning, the sth inst. This sale was concluded between 12 and 1 o'clock of the same day, and to my amftz 'meot nothing more was done in the way of Belliug sheep till Monday morning, the Bth inst., when Mr F. Weaver commenced his sale. In tbe meantime one heard in a!I directions visitors from the country who had come to Sydney to buy sheep bitterly complaining of this loss of time, while at every turn one en countered indignant New Zealand owners won dering wbat game was being played, as the delay was disastrous to the sale of their sheep, and involved very serious increase of expense in their agistment charges. As I have said, Mr Wearer commenced his c sale on Monday morning, the Bth inst , finish* ing that afternoon. On Tuesday morning, the 9fch inst., six days after the cbmmencem- nfc ' of the series, the longwool sheep sales were opened by Messrs Goldsbrougb, Morfc, and Cj., who cab out before 12.30 the same cUy. I thought to my selF, "" Surely there will be no more delay now that the New Zealand sheep have at last been commenced upon,"" but another disappointment for all interested was in store. The next sale, Messrs Pitt, Son, and Badgery, instead of going on that afternoon, was not commenced till Wednesday morning, the 10 h inst., at 10 30. At its conclusion there followed Meaers Harrison, Jonei, and Djvlin and Messrs Hill, Clark, and Co. (in conjunction with Me-8r« Powers, Rutheiford, and Co ), who ie turn finished at aboub 2.45 on Frid»y after noon, the 12th insb. There wss then still left the largest catalogue of New Zealand sheep— that of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Aijoucy Co npany (ia conjunction with Messrs Warden H*rry Graves and Son). Tais sale was commenced on Friday afternoon, at 3 p.m., and continued to its conclusion on Saturday afternoon between 4- and 5 o'clock. The Sydney aheap sales of 1895 therefore extended over » period of 11 weary days. How country buyers with their properties to look after could pos sibly have beni expected to remain in Sydney for such a length of time is a problem I am unable to solve— indeed, as a matter o? fact I •was informed that a large number' of buyers "" bad left; for their: homes long before the gales' were completed. __ On making inquiries from some of the anc fcioneers -as to how such an apparently un businesslike proceeding had oeonrred, I was referred to an agreement which had been entered into and signed by all the agents hold ing B*les, which agreement appeared ia f u)I in Messrs Goldsbrongb, Mort, and Co.'s catalogue. Instead of this agreement throwing any light on tho matter it further puzzled me, as to me it appeared to provide distinctly for the busi ness of the sales proceeding with despatch instead of beiog drawn out as I bave described. I found tbab one of the clauses of the agree ment (Nd. 6) provided that— Tho sales each diy shall coramenco at 10 am., and coutmuc with a break of an hour for luncheon until 5 p.m. In view of the proceedings having been co wid-]y at variance with this portion of the agreement, I prosecuted ray inquiries further, and was informed tbafc the explanation of the whole matter woa ti be fouad in clause No. 3 of the agreement, which reads as follows :— Each auctioneer shall be allowed time for tho conduct of bis sales calculated at the r*te of one minute and a-quarter per lot, to be offered in ac cordance with his catalogue. Incredible us it may seem, the position taken up by the auctioneers who bad drawn an eariy position in the order of sales was that clause No. 6 was completely overridden by clause No. 3, and that if an auctioneer actually r< quired only a fraction of his time allowance, no further business could be done—notwithstand ing clause 6 — till the full time allowance had expired. That a number of business men dealing with important interests could deal with these inte rests in such a manner will no doubt be as puzzUng to yoar readers as it is to roe. It reminds one very forcibly of the old adage, ""Every maa for 1 himself, and de'il take the hindmost."" I have now only to deal with the fourth cause -to which I have attributed the fiasco — viz , the dry season being experienced beco. This no doubt was «n important contributing cause, but had arrangements been made o;i tbo lines I have ventured to suggest — viz., that there should be a concentration of intercuts both in New Zealand and here— there would only have been sent over such a number of sheep as there exii-ted a satisfactory market; for, and drought or ho drought there need have been no fiasco. With my apologies for the leDgth to which - this letter has extended, the excuse for which must be tny desire that my many frien.is in New Zealand should h&ve an unvaruishpd statement of the facts connected with those . tales as far *s I could relate them, — I nm, &c, .

124,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,51,Notes from Cromwell.,"(From Our Own Correspondent.) August 3. — The Electric Dredging Company, on the Kawarau, have got their first dredge, the Ban nockburn, nearly completed, and they will com mence operations iv a day or two. r J.\ ere is a rich spot in iho river, opposite the Chinese ' camp in Cromwell, but the dredge is to work at first, any way, juat below Wilson's coalpit. Whi!_e the boiler was being driven from Queenstown it had a narrow escape from being swept iato the river by a slip which came down while the waggon was passing along a ve>y dangerous part of the road in the Kawarau Gorge. However, the horse took fright at the falling debris, and bolted with the waggon, thus getting out of the road. Mr Roy, one of the shareholders in the dredge, got bis thumb badly smashed whilst assisting in unload ing a wftfrgon load of material, and will be unable to work for eoaie lime. The Lowburn dredge h keeping prat'y well on the sanid ground, being at present above tho Low burn ferry, a short distance below M'Doaald and Dd Botttfiicor's claim. Alluvial mining is at a general standstill owing to the frost. Some of the B^nnockburn mi new have done noihing for nearly two months. The races are blocked with enow, and havo the water turned out of them, with the exception of Mac gregor's, which ia still running. At Quartz Reef, the parties working in the Northburn, and on the ten ace by the Northburn woolshed, are hard at work, but no news of their earnings h»3 come out, tho frosty weather prevent ing waehing up. Mr H. AfurreU has again started to work his claim, which ho abandoned for a time, andisdsiving in towards M' Donald's claim adjoin ing. It i» to be hoped that his enterprise will meet with due reward. The parfcy of Chinese engaged in sluicing at the western boundary of Cromwell are evidently on a good thing, judging by the substantial and, for a Chinaman, pslitial stone houses they have erected. They have boxed their water through the sand, v which was always choking their race, and giving them more work shovelling sand than sluicing. The sand belt on tho Cromwell Flat is a great drawback to mining near the town, and in a menace to the very existence of the town itself. It would ba well worth while to have it planted with marram grass in view of the success of this grass at Otago Heads and the Ocean Beach.",0,-1.042287345,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tbe poisoner mn-it be a most malevolent person, as it is well known tbot poinon may not be laid under any circumstances in a town district, nor within three chains of any public highway outside a town district, or buried lens than two feet below the surface except in a rabbit district.

In tho evening he preached at Kaikora. On Friday, after he had finished brewing, Mr C. Hemmlngsen, seeing a number of sea-gulls abont, took hia gnn and went np the river bed. Presently be saw a gnll circling about a place in the river, and then hovering just above tbe water flapping its wings : suddenly it descended, making a dart in the water and then rose again with something, Mr H. shot at tho bird, scattered its leathers, and caused it to drop a fine cbard (trout) which weighed 2Jlb, and was still living when picked np. During last season, be tells me, he has seen about 150 dead fich floating down, all bearing marks of a bird's claws. This confirms what Mr B.

406,1888-01-19,PATM,Patea Mail,13,THE COBRA AND THE MOUSE.,"I was visiting at a fr' m'V house in Calcutta, says Air 3voa = . .1 “Three Years’ of a Wanderc: F Life,” and was on tins evening sitting at dinner alone. The table had been some time waiting for the host, and X. had at last received a note that he was not coming homo. X sat down alone. I had linisln I ' m.r, and was still lingering’ ax u table, when, a little mouse ran up on the top of a bowl with a sort of basketwork cover on it. I should not have thought that of it self very singular, for the ‘' tribes on our frontier” made most unexpected incursions. But when he did get perched on the cover of the howl, the little follow rose upon his hind legs, with his hands before him, and began to enterain me with the funniest little mouse song you can imagine. | “ Chit chit, cheep-cheep-ch.it,” he whistled and kept it up before me in ; a most unembarrassed .and self possessed little wa i must have been a trying audience, for I leaned back in my chah mid roared with laughter. As I loot ■:i at the lit! n rfortaer I gradu ally became aware of a shadow, a something strange gliding out from behind a dish toward the mouse. Silently and slowly it neared the mouse; in another minute a beady snake’s eye glittered in the lamplight. My hand stole softly for the carving knife iho snake roared his head level with the mouse, and the vjoor little fellow’s song, which hj m never ceased, bec.iuio piercingly shrill, though he sat up rigidly erect and motionless. The head of the snake drew back a little to strike -on* lias lied the carving knife. The spell wax broken instnu ly, for the mouse dropped and scampered. The. snake ■van wounded, for there were spots of blood on tiro tablecloth, and it was writhing about among the dishes and pla es. ~ I could not make a bold stroke at any part of it for fear of . breaking the croc ery, aivd whenever 1 in -do ""a dig with the point it was li e pitching the garter.

325,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,12,WATER SUPPLY COMMITTEE.,"In accordance with the provisions of the award of tho arbitrators re the man? agement of tho water supply, tho Mayor appointed four membors of the Borough Council to servo with himself on tho pro visional committeo as.ropresentatives of tho Borough at 10 o'clock yesterday, morning. Those were Councillors Davies, Wilson, and Gibbons. These, (with the Chairmen of the three Highway Boards, constitute the provisional committee of management. A first meeting of the committee was held yesterday afternoon at the Council Chambers. There were present-the Mayor (in the chair), Messrs Davies, Dr Kilgour, Brodio, MaoDonnell, and Bag nail. His Worship the Mayor was called on to preside. Ho said that now that they wero an independent body, and having nothing to do with either Borough Council or the Highway. Boards, they were met together for tho purpose of considering the water supply plant so as to best benefit all interested. Beyond a certain radius there was no advantage to be gained, for they could not deliver the water at a greater elevation, nor even at tho same elevation, as the reservoir. There wore two things to bo taken into consideration, the first being the supply itself, and tho second tho question of funds. He did not seo that there would be any difficulty on tho other points, and ho was quite suro thoy would all do what they could to smooth over tho difficulties. They woro mot to inaugurato tho com mittee of management, and to discuss any matter of business brought before them, As a first step ho would lay beforo them tho sohedulo of property at tho disposal of the committee, drawn up by Mr Laurie, tho acting turncock.—Dr Kilgour suggested that their first business was to strike a rate for the ensuing year, but on tho suggestion of Mr Bagnall, Mr Doan was rcquosted to act as secretary, and complied.—Mr Laurio was also ap pointed to rotairi'charge as turncock. - Aftor some discussion it was agreed that tho mooting, instead of passing re solutions, should confine itself to discuss ing matters with a view to making recommendations to tho permanent com mitteo. The present rating sohomo was discussed, and considered unsatisfactory, and it was arranged to rccommond that tho water rate loviod should bo at so much per room, that the publicans' rates should • also bo charged at per room, attention being directed to tho faot that many rooms woro unoccupied in public houses, and that boilers should bo supplied at bo much per horse power. It was suggested that a committeo be appointed to proparo a tariff of charges, but this was not aoted upon, and after a good deal of desultory conversation, tho moot ing adjourned until Tuesday next. EATING MINING PROPERTY. In reply to the telegram forwarded to tho Premier by Mr W.

111,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,38,Pastoral Runs.,"TO THM EDITOR. Sm, — Columns — nay, volumes — have been from time to time written suggesting remedies and advancing theories in solution of the much-vexed rabbit question ; but there is another matter closely allied to it, and of even greater importance to the individual and the State, which does not receive the attention it decerves — namely, the most profitable method of dealing with the pastoral lands of the colony, especially in the South Island. At almost every meeting of the Land Board appear applications from unfortunate lessses of runs to surrender, chiefly srrull grazing runs, far which absurdly high rents were given. With wool at 5d par Ib, store sheep at lOd per head, and rabbi tskins down to about half their former value, it is a matter of surprise there bave been so few such applications from holders of pastoral leases. This terrible winter will, however, in too many instances act as the last straw, and unless the Government wish to see the complete Collapse of a very large number of its pattoral tenants, very substantial, and in many cases permanent, reductions in rent will nndonbtedly have to be made. Bub it is not likely to surfer an industry of such vast importance to come to giief for lack of timely succour. My present object is not to plead for the un fortunate squatter of to-day; but with your permission, Sir, I will endeavour, not only to point ont a means whereby the rabbit pest could be better controlled, if not conquered, but likewise a means of restoring the pastoral land* of the colony to their original valuable ■tate, and made to carry at least three sheep where two are very insufficiently provided for at present. I think it will be pretty generally conceded, by 'at least thoie in a position to know, that the pastoral lands in many parts of the colony have during the last 15 years depreciated quite SO per cent., and it requires no prophet to foretell what the result will be at the end of another decade if the present system of leasing and the same insane policy of dealing with the purely pastoral rang are continued— namely, insecurity of tenure and alienation of all available winter country from the runs of the interior ; for good ness knows Nature made but scanty provision as a refuge in severe winters. Much of the loss sustained during this terrible winter may safely be attributed to the effect of this most short-sighted polioy in the past. There are in Central Otago and Waitaki | hundreds of thousands of acre*, which at one time represented the very pick of grazing land, now changed into a barren waste from the ravages of the rabbits, indiscriminate burning, and the dryness of the climtto. A' most the only vegetation found in these desett-like localities is confined to the mountain tops, where it is seldom available for stock in winter. j To remedy this, Sir, I would suggest the application of the small grazing run tenure to all purely pastoral country, giving security of tenure for 21 yews, with valuation for improve ments to the extent of five years' annual rental of each run, with right of renewal, and with the right to cultivate any auitable portions in growing turnips Of other feed for young stock in winter. All land thus treated to be afterwards sown with permanent grasses, and count as improvements. With a fixitj of tenure, and in the security of his position, the lessee would be encouraged to improve and increase the carrying capacity of his run by nub-dividing it, and in surface sow ing all suitable parts with some permanent grasses. The seed for this purpose might very properly be supplied by the State, and the farmers who grew it would at the same time be benefited. By lowing a small area annually on each run during the tirm of k-ase a remarkable and bfneficUl change would very soon become apparent. Dry and barren looking as most of the interior undoubtedly is there are consider able areas on most runs where grasses ruch as coclccfoot would grow and spread by seeding. Now that all the natural vegetation is gone from off the steep hill sides there is nothing to bind and keep the soil thr-re, which by every shower that falls is washed down into the river beds, until at no very distant date there will be nothing left but the bare reef. Surely something might be done, or at least attempted, to avert what will one day be seen to be a nabional calamity. To permit grasses sown in this manner to take root and Sourish the rabbits would have to be kept down Encouraged by' his improved position the lessee would very naturally take energetic measures, and adopt every expedient to clear his run of rabbits. Instead of the pastoral runs in many parts of the colony being, as at present, property that no one with money and sense will touch, and the present unfortunate occupiers anxious to get rid of, they would in a few years become valuable and readily marketable, and the un employed cry would no longer be heard in the land, as work for large numbers of men would be found in fencing, grass sowing, longer shear ings, rabbiting, &o. The change I have indicated, being quite within the pale of practical politics and not ia any way chimerical, I am satisfied the intro duction of some such system in lieu of the existing uncertain state of pastoral tenure would mean the expansion of the wool-growing in dustry of the colony and greatly increased pro sperity. To pursue the present policy simply means the abandonment at no very distant date of a very large area of the pastoral estate of the colony. I ooramend the serious comideration of tbi« very momentous question to the Hon. Minister for Lands. — I am, &c., August 6.

The Dunvegan Castle, a new Cape liner to take the place of the ill-fated Drum mond Castle, is now on her first voyage from London to South Africa. She is described as one of the most luxurious ships in the world.—The committee of experts appainted to Inquire into the causes of the Drummond Castle disaster have reported to Parliament that the wreck was due to the captain's error in proceeding at too great a speed in a very dangerous locality. Whitehead the released dynamiter, who had disappeared has been discovered in Cork. He was asking the hour of a ship's departure for America, when recognised by a quay laborer. He is thought to be out of his mind. His brother has taken him to New York. Dr Gallagher on his arrival in America, became so violent that a straight-jacket was necessary, and he is now in an asylum hopelessly insane. Over L2OO was spent in drink recently by a Hertfordshire family making a tour of America. The family consisted of the mother, and two sons and a daughter. They purchased the liquor wholesale, and drank it in their hotel. After the carouse, which ended on Satur day, the debauchees were found lying on the floor of one of their rooms in the hotel. One son was dead, the daughter was insane, and the other son and the mother were suffering from delirium tremens. The British Museum claims to have the oldest love-letter in the world. It is an inscribed brick, the inscription being a proposal of marriage, and the date is that of 3500 years ago.

Shortly after arriving in the gold country he had been told that his wife was dead. When he returned he found her still alive.

236,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,163,ONLY FOUR TO MAN THE PUMPS.,"Dear, dear ! When you oome to think of it how closely related things are ; how one thing brings up another. Ideas are like a lot of beads on a siring, aren't they P A letter I have ju«t been reading makes mo remember what happened to me one winter about 20 years ago. The story is too long to tell here, »o I'll merely give you the tail end of it. I wai supercargo on a barque bound from London to Rio. A tremendous gale, lasting fi?e days, wrecked us. Forty-eight hour» after it otased there were four men and no more left on the vessel. Th« captain had been killed by a falling spar, three of the crew washed overboard, and. the rest of the ship's company (save us four) went away in the long boat with the first and second mates. We were taking iv water through a leak at the rate of six inohei'au hour. Working with all our might the four of us could pump that out in 40 minutes, but we must do it every hour. It was awful work. For two daya we kept it up without sleep. Then we stopped, took to the quarter boat, and shoved off. The sea was quiet— no wind. While we lay-to within a mile of her, the chip threw up her nose aud went down stern first. We were picked up the next day by a Danish brig. Now the odd thing is th»t the letter which reminded me of that experience h»s nothing whatever to Bay about ships. Please help me to find out the association. The lady who writes the letter says that in July 1881 she got a bad fright. Exactly whaft it was she doesn't tell. I wish tthe did. Any way it so upset her that she didn't get over tha effects of it for nine years. After that hec appetite fell off ; she lost all real relish foe food, and what she did eat only made troubles instead of nourishing her. lb gave her pain in the pit of the stomach and (curioualy enough) between the shoulders. She says her oyes andi skin presently turned yellow as a buttercup. Her face and abdomen swelled, and her feet the same, the latter so much so that the was obliged to have her shoes made larger. "" I got little sltep at nigat,"" she says, '• aud was in so much pain I had to be propped up with pillows. For weeks together I could nob lie down in bed. I had a dry, hollow cough, and bad night Bweats. Then diarrhoea set in, and my bowels became ulcerated. I wss often in dreadful agony for 48 hours at a time. Then I would have a chill as though a bucket of cold water were poured down my back. I got so low I could no longer sew, knit, or do any house work, or look after my children. My sister had to come and help in the house. ""Everybody said I was in a decline, and must die. What I luffered for eight years tongue cannot tell. The doctor could do no thing for me. He said my complaint was conn plicated and bad to deal with. In 1886 I went as an outdoor patient to the Shrewsbury In firmary, but only got transient; relief."" The writer is in good health now, but why did her case remind me of the shipwreck? Let's settle fchafc first. The aisociation is easy and natural. Just see. The ship sank because we four men hadn't the strength to pump out the water as fast as it came in. Twenty men might have got her into port. It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back; the last uusupplied need that makes poverty abject and desperate. These bodies of ours carry the Seeds of disease with them all the time — chiefly the poisons created by imperfect digestion, made worse by careless habits. Bub as long as nothing extra ordinary happens we manage to scrape along in a half-and-half sorb of fashion. Yet we've got in our blood the stuff that any of a dozen diseases is made of, only waiting for something to set it afire. While the liver, kid neya, lungs, and skin keep us .fairly free— that is, don't let the load get too heavy — we say, ""Oh, yes, I'm tolerably well, thank you."" Little pains and unpleasant symptoms bother us now and then, but we don't fancy they mean anything. By-and-bye something happens. A cold, too hearty a meal, a night of dissipation, an afflic tion through death or loss of property, a fright (as in Mrs Bunce's case), &c. Over we go. The last straw has crushed us. One loose spark has blown up the barrel of powder. The crew is' too small to save the ship. The kidneys, liver, skin, aud stomach strike work, and we must have help right away or perish. All of which means the explosion of latent indigestion and dyspepsia poisons in the blood, There ! isn't it plain why I though!; of the ship ? Now for the conclusion of the lady's story. She says: ""In 1889 I first heard of Mother Seigel'a Curative Syrup. Half a bottle made me feel better, and by keeping on taking it I was soon strong and well as ever. (Signed) Mm Ann Buuce, The Park, Worthen, near Shrewsbury, February 22, 1893.""

140,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,67,DEATH OF JUSTICE RICHMOND.,"Wellington, August 4. Mr Justice Richmond died at his -residence at 6 o'clock last evening from pneumonia and inflammation of the lungs supervening on in fluenza, at the age of 74 years. He attended the sitting of the Appeal Court on Saturday, 27th July, but has since bten confined to tha house. His death whs rather unexsiecbt-.d. Christopher William ttichmond, one of the ju<3ges of the Supreme Court of the colony, was boru in London in 1821. He became a student of the Middle Temple in January 1844, and was called to the English bar on the 20ba oE January 1847. After practising in Bugland for some time, he came to the colony in 1853, and practised at New Plymouth for some jeats. Ho acted as Provincial Solicitor of the Province of Tarauaki, and became a member of the House of Representatives in 1855, where he occupied a conspicuous position until 1861, in which year he retired from political life. As a member of the Stafford Ministry — which came into power on 2nd June 1856— he held the office of Colonial Secretary until 4th November of the came year. He then became Colonial Treasurer, an office which he resigned on 25th February 1859, being succeeded by Mr Sewell. On the 27th of August 1858 he became also Minister foe Native Affairs, which position he held until November 10, 1860, being succeeded by Mr Weld. He again became Colonial Treasurer on the 26th of April 1859, and held this office and also that of Commissioner of Cuotums until July 12, 1861, when the Stafford Ministry was defeated. As a member of the Cabinet; Mr Richmond took a leading interest in all publio questions. Much of the legislation during the periodhe was in the House was influenced by bis ability. He took an especially active part in connection with Native affairs, and was associated with the historical Waitara dispute. He favoured the administration of the Native department being placed under responsible government in the colony. .After, retirement from political life he came to Duuedin, where he joined Mr T B. Gillies (afterwards Mr Justice Gillies) in partnership as barristers and solicitoi s. At this time the gcldfields were attracting a large population to Obago, and considerable legal business was transacted in Dunedin. Mr Richmond acquired a leading share in the practice of his profession, aud was greatly esteemed, both for bis ability and integrity as a lawyer and his usefulaers as a citizen. On the 20th October 1863 he was appointed by the Domett Ministry to the Supreme Court bench This position he occupied till the date of his death. On his appointment he was located in Dunedin, beiug the sole judge in Otago till the 23rd March 1864, wheu the late Mr Justice Chapman was appointed as his colleague. He remained in Dunedin until 1867, when the judicial district of Nelson and Westland was assigned to him, and he resided in Nelson until he removed to Wellington. It wou'd be difficult to speak in tco high terms of him as a judge. Ou the admiuifttration of justice he brought to bear a subtle intellect and high culture. He was essentially a strong judge ; probably no stronger judge has occupied the bench of this colony. Well read and widely informed, he w*s an ornament to the bench. Apart from his high personal character, his ability and industry commanded universal admiration. In Of ago especially, where he was well kuown to many of the early settlers, he was looked up to with the profoundest respect, and possessed their fullest confidence. Although frequently in indifferent health, he was always mentally vigorous and intensely earnest. Whilst on the bench he decided a large number of important oases, his judgments in many of which are classic. Wheu in Duaedin he presided at the second trial, in September 1865, of Captain Jarvey for wife poisoning, his conduct on the bt-nch commanding universal approbation. He also presided at the famous trial at Hokitika, in May 1868, of certain Fenians who were charged with sedition, and whom Mr Ireland (of Vic tori*) came over to defend. His summing up in this prosecution was not only a' mtuiterly expotition of the law relating to political offences, but was an able and unimpa«sioned address to the jury on the duties devolving on them as colonist*. As a colonist, a statesman, and a judge, Mr Justice Richmond bas rendered lasting services. His death will be deeply regretted by the public, and especially by the bar of the colony. He was married to a sister of the late Sir Harry Atkinson before he left England, who survives him, and he leaves five daughters (two of whom are married) and four eons.",0,-1.114670699,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,137,CANTERBURY DOINGS.,"At the time of writing the wexther is beauti. ful, and should it continue the National meeting will be a great success. A big contingent of strangers has already arrived, and the great majority of the horses are very fit ; and in respect of the principal races to be decided on Thursday and Saturday the fields will not only be averagely big, but quality will be well represented on both days. There was some talk of reducing the big sod wall in the steeplechase country, but that fence will not be interfered with ; as a matter of fact it is barely 4ft hi«h dow, The Riccarton country is generally supposed to be the moat stiff one, but its htiffnefs merely lies in the strength of its lences. There i» no ob-uacle in the country tbat an ordinarily good 'cuaser or hunter ought not to negotiate easily enough in regard to actual dimensions. The caretaker is no,w very busy in bringing the grouud to a t.tite of perfection, and, should present atmospheric conditions last, fast times may be expected. The- course' of a morning now is something like a small race meetjnu no far ■a* attendance goes, and Christchurch is already practically full of visitors. Both lvgardingJioiso 5 ) and "" assistants"" at the meeting the North Island will' bo strongly represented, and the sister isle is pretty confident of annexing a big lump of the stake m ney. The enterprise of Northerners, too, will undoubtedly be rewarded to a certain extent, but I hardly think they will give the Southerners such a ""doing "" as some people seem to imagine. Mr Willi imson has arrived ftvm Auckland with. Despised, Marechal Niel, and Ulster, and both 'cha-<ers are supposed to be daugeious steeplechase horses, but I do not much care for either. MarfCh'il Niel was jumped to-day, and no did not jump over well, though I do not take much notice of that I do not think, however, that Marechal Niel is a tip-top steeplechaser, though he 111 iy run' well in tho Enfield steeplechase all the same. Despised does not look unfit at all, but he does not have the appearance of aprobabla National winner. • Liberator is in rare nfck, and he may ba good enough to win the ''double."" A great many people about here fancy him for the big hurdle race, but my opinion of him is that be will run a real good race in the National. Butler told me this morning, tao, that ho expects him to nego tiate the country all right;. Norton (Mr Gollan up) was jumped this (Mon day) morning with Lascar, but hi-i jumping was anything but fault}e33. Tlut rruy not matter much, however — he is usually a safe conveyance — but I fancy, somehow, he will meet his matrh in the National, good horse though he is. At the same time he is greatly fancied here. Since hia arrival Itosoiua has both jumped and galloped on the flat at Riccarton, and tlu-re is no doubt he is a far better horse than he wjs last year. Some people seem to think he will i'ot get over the National country, but I d j not know so much about that. He is a fancy of mine at any rate, and I think h» is one likely to run well. Mutiny cjuld not be made any better than he is at present, and there is no doubt that Geoige Hope's stable fancy they have a good double in Mutiuy and Couranto. Undoubtedly Courauto is iirrare btu-kl(>, aud be will require a deal of beating in the big huvdles. I «o ild rather ba-k Courauto to win the Grand National Hurdle Rice than 1 would Mutiny to win the National, strongly though. Mutiny is fancied here. Auatr.il is in rare fettle, and he and Bjpa Fide will not go home minus somethiug if their train ing can gain a victory. JB^th seam to be good horses, too. Crystal is anything but a tikiog horse. He is one of the canty, plodding kind, that may jump well a:.d stay for a week, but he is coitainly not up to anything like the best cla'«R of steeplechasers now located at Riccari#n. He seems to be a strong-, hardy customer, however, that can jump well. Barnardo has been sore on one or two occasions, but I do not think there is anything much wrong with him. He galloped all right this morning, at anyrate. Kalnirangi and P!gmont came down, together from the North Island, and were 36 hours afloat betwesn ""Wellington and Lyttelton. Kahuraugi escaped mishap, but has since died. JSgniont is in a terrible state. He got down in his berth *nd could not got up again, and as a matter of consequence his fore legs ara. swollen badly from the arms to the coronets, and his hocks are about three times their ordinary size. The hair and bkin have been rubbed off parts of his body, too, andunfortuna'ely he will not race again for a tevr months. At present he can hardly walk. A very fair kind of horse is Donald M'Kinnon, though he did not jump particularly well oa Saturday morning. He ought, nevertheless, to run well at the meeting. Jim Cotton has arrived from Dunedin with Victim and Biin, and the former is as fit as a fiddle. He appears to me to be an uncommonly good horse of his inches He went twice round the tan this morning, and I think he has a big outside show of winning the Grand National Hurdle Race on Si tut day. He is a capital mover, and he is in m< st el.iii'ic condition. For a good maoy years I have known what Jim can do in the training live— and the riding department, too, for that matter— and I will aver that he has brought Victim up here as fit as he can be- made, however he may come off financially. Sunspot, who was jumped this morning- with Gabel-el-Tarjk, has made most wonderful im provement since his sojourn at Riccarton. To-day he jumped very well indeed, and beyond doubt 'he has a chance of winning a race at the meeting. A good horse is Boomerang, but 1 fanry Repo is considerably better, and should Rep j be beaten in the; First Hunters' Hurdle Race I fancy Much Ado will do the trick. That mare had a most useful ""twice round"" gallop on the grass thil morning, and with Harry Moore in the saddle went very takingly. A rattling go d sort, of a' hunter is Armstrong, and he will run. well at the. meeting. He-.-is a hoi bo I like, whatever he may go for. la that class there is a good novae down here in Social Pest. He is the first of Ahua's get I have ever sbcu, and he is a good one. Through stocial Pest 1 fancy Ahua will bs a good siro. I will nut say much about' the wetter' races to-night, though I fancy Vogengang* bas-a big say in tbe Winter Handicap Triton is a'- good horse, however, and Bbould Mystical ran- ho- will glvo some of them paste. Regarding the Tally-ho Steeplechase I would just as soon back Blackbird as any of them, though llawei may do him for speed. Glengarry is not a bad one either. There are- several horses in that race I do not know, but Blackbird will want a lot of "" doing.""

Even the nails are identical, hard-pointed and claw like, tipping tbe orange fingers with a length eqaal, in some cases, to 3in. It is no inter loper in a well-regulated family of oranges, but a regular member, belonging to the osage variety.' It has a family name and a Christian name of its own, but its pet name is "" five-fiDgered orange,"" and nobody but tbe botanist cares, to ca.ll it by the long one which means tbe same thing. Tbe orange tree is, a ragged little shrub that does not average more .than sft or 6ft in height. It does not grow straight, and it would be very difficult to find two consecutive inches in the entire tree whose line of direction is the Bame. Even the branches grow in spiral form?, so that tbe width of the tree is often as great as tbe height. There is a generous supply of thorns bidden under the leaves ; they are slender, tough, and long, and are located in all sortß of unexpected places. The leaves are fleshy, long, and narrow, and of a dark green colour. They resemble a lemoa leaf more than an orange leaf. In deed, in both this instance and in the colour of tbe ripeced fruit, this singular plant seems to cla?""m a very close cousinsbip to the large lemon family. The flowers come out in June and July, and are very similar in appearance and odour to the ordinary orange blossoms, save that instead of the familiar creamy white colour they bare a delicate pinkish tint which is very beautiful. They com monly grow in clusters of* two or three blossoms on alternate nodes. The strangest thing connected with the perfume is that it is the fruit and not the flower that is most odorous. The fruit when ripe is so redolent that its scent can be recognised a mile from where the orange is growing. Rats' Teeth. — The teeth of rats are kept shfirp by a very peculiar provision of Nature. The outer edge of the incisors is covered with ft layer of enamel as. bard as flint, while the tinder side is much softer. The layers of enamel on the under side, therefore, wear away much faster than those on the upper Burface, and a keen cutting edga ia always prp=ented. Sleep. — Very many of the lower order of creatures are said to live without sleep. Many short-lived insects do so, and fishes arc not generally snpposed to eDJoy sleep, although many species do periodically rest for about a couple of hours at a time. Ex periments have shown that the salmon, pike, goldfish, and angler fish do not sleep at all. Fishes have no eyelids like the higher mam malia, and their brain is very small in pro portion to their siza. -Animals which have no real brain cannot be said to enjoy true Bleep, tbe chief feature of which is the cessation of automatic activity of the brain. On the other hand, there are some animals which obtain an excessive amount of sleep, such as snails, which have been known to Bleep for four years at a time. — Extract from the criminal record : ° John Mulcahey fell out of a window yester day, and was seriously injured about the head.

89,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,16,OPERATIONS FOR THE WEEK.,"Kitchen Gaeden. — The improvement in the weather must be taken advantage of to plant out cabbages from the seed bed"", lifting the plants with a trowel so as to break as few root fibres as possible. It is a mistaken plan to dr»w the plants from the soil, stripping off nearly all the youog roots, and ao bruis ing the remainder that in the event of wet weather following the transplant ing, it is almost impossible for tbe plant to make a start. The cabbage will survive a good deal of ill-treatment, but the principle that in all vegetable culture the plants must be grown on without check should always be kept in view if successful results ate to be obtained. Any preparations which can be ra&de in the plots in tended for onions, carrots, and parsnips should be made at once, so that there shall be no delay when the time comes for sowing the seed. Sow par*ley, peas, and beans to succeed former sow iDgs. Sow cucumbers in pots, and place in. a hot-bed ; put in the seeds edgeways, and don't give much water until the seed leaves appear. Cuthiil's black spine, Duke of Edinburgh, and Rollison's telegraph are good varieties. Flower Gaeden. — The change to milder weather starts spring-flowering plantsinto active growth, and the youDg wood being very suscep tible of injury from frost all the tender kinds should be protected by evergreen boughs. Anemones and ranunculus not planted in autumn should be got in as soon as the soil is dry enough, as there is a danger of deterioration of the flowers if the planting of bulbs is delayed after they have shown signs of activity. The soil in the beds for these should be deep, and if it is composed of clay it should be removed altogether and a good turfy compost substituted. A light soil well enriched with old cow manure will grow the ranunculus and anemone to per fection, but these bulbs can Got be grown in a stiff, clay soil. When turning over the soil keep a sharp lookout for wireworm and the larvce of the brown beetle, which will destroy the bulbs of the ranunculus especially. Remove the mulching from hyacinth beds, as the nibs are now showing ; if it is left too long they will be drawn up weakly, and if wet weather should prevail they will be in danger of rotting. Greenhouse — The cyclamen is f aßt becoming a favourite plant with amateurs, as it seldom fails to grow and bloom 'even under adverse treatment. Of late years, too, the improvement both in form and colour of the flowers has been very great ; it is but yesterday, as it were, that the white bloom with the purple ring was the sole representative of the Persicum species, but now we have all shades, from pure white up to the deepest scarlet and plum-colour. The size of the blooms has also been much increased, the old Per&icum looking very poor by the side of the giganteum and grandiflorum strains now to be, seen. The seed, if not sown already, should ba put in at once, in pans of light sandy coil. The seed appears to form a small bulb fin>fc, from which one seed-leaf is thrown up. When the second leaf can be seen, the small bulb may be lifted with a pointed stick and potted in fins soil in a tbumb-pot. In a house with a temperature of 55deg the pots may be placed near the glass, and if the plants are potted ou as they require it, they can be bloomed in 12 months from the time of sowing the seed. Give plenty of air to the greenhouse plants generally, a little more water to those in active growth, and, above all, don't hurry the plants forward.",0,-1.144109964,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

83,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,10,A REMARKABLE CARGO.,"Oar luvercargill correspondent writes : — *' Messrs Tarnbul), Martin, and Co.'s s.s. Bute shire- (J. Cuthbert, commander) left the Bluff at 12.30 on Saturday afternoon for Lyttelton f drawing 25ft water forward and 22ft 6in aft, baviDß on board 2050 tons Queensland beef, 5,256 cases preserved meats, 216 do and crates .'tongues, and 1284 casks tallow. The 2052 tons beef are made up of 15,843"" hindquarters, 8578 'forequarters, and 344 pieces, showing that to supply this enormous cargo at least 7922 fat cattle must have been slaughtered. The South land portion of her cargo comprises 9493 car oases frofcen mutton, 1330 cases meats, and sundry other cargo in the shape of wool, 'tallow, &c!, and 808 live' sheep (carefully .selected prime long-woolled wethers) and the following fodder for their use on the voyage to ""London :— Five tons swedes, 45 do bran, 30 do oaten chaff, 10 do crushed oats, 1 do Unseed. At Lyttelton she takes on board another 400 live sheep, 50 tons clover hay, .and 10 tons crushed peas, and another 5000 carcases of frozen mutton. The Buteshire has great capacity for carrying large cargoea of live stock, which in tbis instance are all com fortably housed on the main deck two tiers high, her deck gross measurement is beam 54ft, length 435 ft, and the space allotted to each sheep on this occasion is sft 6in superficial measurement. This experimental shipment, ob so large a scale, is made by and on account of the owners, Messrs Turnbull, Martin, and Co., and is by far the largest ever yet made ' from a New Zealand or Australian port. If found successful there is ample space on the main deck of this magnificent beat to house 1600 sheep, allowing same space per head as the present consignment are receiving. Mr Robert Scott, for many years managing sheep on the Cheviot estate for the late Hon. W. Robin<on, takes charge of this live cargo on the voyage Home, and will have with him five assistants, and be prepared, if deemed advisable, to shear the shee-p after getting round Cape Horn. They will be due in London the last week in September. Captain Cuthbert, who has carried 'with marked success a previous, but much smaller, consignment of New Zealand sheep Home, takes a very lively interest in this living portion of his valuable freight, and his long experience (firtt in the old Elderslie) and noted abilities as shipmaster and all-round capabilities go a long way towards assuring the successful issue of this spirited venture of Messrs .

We have had almost cloudless Hkiss,, biilliaut sunshine, genial warmth tempered by pleasant breezes, and without any excessive he&t. It ib ideal June weather. Unfortunntely, all this meteorologi cal joy ia not enough for the British farmer, or, rather, is 100 much for him. He wants rain. A very long period of dryness bus nc^r prevailed over the greater pirt of these islands, and un'ess copious showers fall before long, I ftar the agricultural consequences will be serious. Prayers for rain are being offered up in the churches. Our gracious Sovereign is enjoying be r se!f in the distant Highlands, sow looking their loveliest, but returns to town next week, after which various State functions will be held. Tho Queen goes.next to Oaborne, and in August will pay .auother visit to Bal moral. * The secret about the last Royal Drawing Room b»8 oozed out. People suspected all along that there was some special reason why the Princes-s of W»les did not hold it instead of Princess Louise, seeing that she had uudeitakeu to hold the laßt two Drawing Rooms. They were right. I am told on high authority that when the list of names of ladies to -be presented at the second Drawing Room — duly signed by the Lord Chamberlain and approved by the Queen — was submitted to the Princess of WaleH Bhe took exception to one particular name, and required that it Bhoold be erased. As tho lady to whom she objected is Ires grandt dame and belongs to one of England's most famous families, this demand croak d the utmost consternation. IChe Princess was implored to give way, and every possible argument was employed to con since her of tho necessity of yielding. But Alexandra would not budge an inch from. the {position she had taken up. "" I have made too many concessions already,"" she said, "" and I will make no more."" What was to be done ? Lord Carrington, tho Chamberlain, deplored his inability to comply with the Princess's requet-t. ""Then,"" replied the Princess, ""I Bhall not hold tne Drawing Boom."" Lord Carrington tried his utmost powers of per- Buision, but in vain. ""It is useless to urge it,"" B&id the Princess. ""I have ffiven way too much already on this point, and I will do so no more."" So the Chamberlain had to depart foiled. He proceeded to Windsor, and laid the matter before the Queen, who communicated the Heir Apparent. Nothing came of it. The Queen was convinced that it would never do to erase the name of the lady objected to, who under another name had attended many DrawiDg Rooms before, but who on this occa sion had to be presented afresh it being her first appearance after accession to a higher title. So it was agreed that the Princess of Wales should l)e excused on the score of indisposition. Alexandra found out what was the plan. I believe she had her suspicion?, and pressed her ' inquiries .as to what would be done in conse quence of her refufal until she succeeded in ascertaining r?hat was proposed. What followed was this : — Ten days before the date of the Queen's intended departure for Scotland, the Princess of Wales and her two Tmmarried daughters imde a hurried and un expected visit to Windsor with the ostensible ob ject of Baying good-bye to her Majesty. And then 5 learn on very good authority a remarkable eoene took place. Alexandra, the fair and gentle, exprf ssed her view* with quite unpre cedented ■warmth and passion. "" Nothing shall induce me to hold the Drawing Raom if that person ia allowed to bo present,"" I am told the Princess said, "" and I hear that if I do not it will be said that I refused on account of illness. That will be utterly untrue, a'ld I iviSl publioly contradict it. If lam reported to be ill I will drivo about London and the Park all the ftfti.rni.on on which the Drawing Koom is hold pnd will show niyatlf as publicly as possible, uulcßa that person is excluded a« I have desired."" Now, can you possibly describe such a situa tion otherwise than in the vulgar phrsse "" a pretty kttUe of fish ""? I don't' think so. At jinyrate the Queen found horbt-lf.quite impotent the face of the Princess's determination. Alexandra was fairly roused at last. And she canied her point. No official announcement of her indisposition was made. Priucasa Louise held tbe Drawing Roam. And the proscribed lady was not jyresint.' Of course everybody understands that a private intimation was conveyed to her I hat she had bebter find some excuse for staying away this time else there would asaurtdly be *' wigs on the green,"" and things might be ren i dered unpleasant for her in various quarters. The lady in question is no fool. Far from it. | She is as clever as she is beautiful, and that is saying a good defil, as I cau testify from per sonal observation. I will not do my New Zealand readers the injustice io suppose for a momeut that they need any key — which it might be iujudicious to furnish—to this curious little affair. I feel sure I may take it that they ""take"" me, and that awkward explanations arc needless. And I think I may assume also that they will concur in myview as to the extreme regretfulness of all thia. Indeed, I am very much afraid we have not yet heard the last ot it. Happily, that odious story about the Duke of York's alleged morganatic alliance seems to have died away, for the present at any rate. I trust it may not be revived. The Duke and Duchess seem to live very hoppily, and their popularity remaius unabated. But I cannot discover whether or not the ""insupfr*ble obsi acle "" to their Royal Highnesses' desired visit to the colouie* is ieally what ever j body imagines, or whether those society journals which stoutly deny it are accurate. How ever, we shall all know in good time. Mean while, they won't visit you just yet. It is said that the Queen never goes into public without a half-acknowledged dread that her life might be attempted ; it has been so six times during, her reign. It is 55 years sinco the first attempt. This was by a jomg bar man named Oxford. He fired two Bh(.t« at her M*jet>ty and the Prince Consort as they* were driving up Constitution Hill. The Queen showed the greatest courage, and her husband was far more exercised on her account than she was ""for her own. Oxford was kept in asylums for 25 years, and then was released on condition that he left the country. No one knows -if he is still alive. Just two years after, at the same place and with a pistol also, another youth named Francis attacked the Queen. He was condemned to death, but the extreme penalty was remitted. I think that he died in confinement. Some say that he was liberated ou a ticket-of leave, but I doubt it. The other attempts are too trivial to record, and the allegod one of which the papers made each capital last week was too trivial in the extreme. The man was a lunatic, and is now in the asylutn for life. A London paper has got hold of some special data respecting the meat's of the Queen. Ib has got them from a book printed for private circu lation only by a recently deceased auditor of the Royal accounts for 50 years. Full detail* are given, and the auditor arrive 3at the total of her Majesty's wealth, by simple calculations, too involved,' however, to reproduce without explanation. This total is £35,000,000. Her purßonalty, such as pictures, &c , is not in cluded in the estimate. It seems a strange broach of offi :iivl duty to make such dis closures, even with tbe thin vuieor of privacy. But the chronicler does not. takes into ace.ouut the £2,700,000 the Quean puid off of tho old debts of her uncle? George Bnd William, aud her father, the Dake of Ifeufc. v The Shahzadiv can scarcely bo called a social success, inasmuch as he has quite ignored the fair sex, and does not seem to like to be spoken to by them. Th* Lady Mayoress, as in duty bound, curtseyed low in Ear«.p-an fashion on the occasion of hu visit to the city, but the Prince p<ud no attention to htr greet ing, and actually hesitated to take the place assigned him at the banquet — viz , at her right hand. And it is further said that he never does acknowledge the salutations of the fair sex. Tho old Shah of Persia us id to admire our pretty women too much if anything, and call them '♦ angels."" It is said on good authority that he made a handsome off»r for one or two he had specially admired.

At the least provocation they 3raw knives and deal death if they can. I had a very good view of the Afghan Prince as he went to the Guildhall reception, for his carriage passed close in front of the window of your London office. His appearance did nob strike me precisely as it seems to have done some of my friend-} and oor reppondents. I thought his fac<j\intelligent, and by no means ugly. As to hi* stolid non obseivautness, that was not so in my experience. As he passed be caught sight of the beautiful lantern tower of the Church of St. Duustan in the West, which is opposite my office window. He turned sharply round, and evidently asked Sir Gerald Fitzgerald sevoral questions about the building and its history. At anvrata that is what he ceemod to me to do. There were great grumblinge at the whole traffic of the busiest part of the city b ing stopped several hours in the busiest part of the day for the Shahzada's twopetmy-halfponny procession. The crowd of spectators was of modest dimensions for London, and for a wonder was almost exclusively masculine. The latest social surprise is the marriage of the Duke of Argyle, a veterau of 72, to Miss M'Neill, an ingenue of 21. Tha ""Yellow haired Laddie,"" as the* Scots call the chieftain of the Clan Cimpbell, is a muchly-martied man. His firat wife was a daughter of the Duchess of Sutherland, the Queen's intimate friend. She bore him 12 children, and then made room for No 2, the widow of Colonel Auson, and daughter of Bishop Claughton. This la 1y died last year, and she was taken to Canneß in the Riviera, in compliance with her dying request and laid bes'de her flrat huiband. But the legend on her tombstone, a cross of purest marblf, is—"" The beloved wife of the Duke o? Argyll."" The marriage was [not felicitous. A well-known nobleman told a friend of mine some years ago, that both had indomitable wills, aud they could not hit it off at all. At one time there was a rumour of a separation. "" It was very foolish of Argyll "" said the noble man in question, ""to marry a woman of 40 ; he ought to have married some falce soft young girl, and had her trained into his own ways and ideas."" This is just what the gentle man was doing himself, but ho died before his experiment had fluished her education. Ho, however, left her his entire fortune, the title dying with him. The Duke has tho character of being a terrible ""boss in his own famity."" All his daughters are married except tho Lady Victoria, who ia sadly delicate. She is quite given up to good works. The M'Neills axe Highlanders, and as proud of their family as M* Call urn Mohr of his. There is much spsoulation as to the sort of work Oscar Wilde has to peff orm in the priaoD, and many believed that the old treadmill had censed it* mission. This is not so, and the high priest of reslheticißm has to keep it going just like any Philistine, gome houra a day. He had also to pick oakum. He is isolated from all companionship. It is underatood that he is at CMdb&th Fields Prison. His costume is a drab moleskin suit-, including knickerbockers, markod with the broad arrow. He has blue stockings, not of the art shade, strong shoes, and a white linen cap. He will ba kept three months at the wheel, and then employed in some roetshanicol work, trade, or at odd jobs about the yard. Lady Wilde is seriously ill, and at her advanced age it is unli^ly that she will ever see her brilliant son again. Mrs Frank LasHo, who for a brief peri-id called Mr Willie Wilde, Oscar's brother, husband, in here; She has been most kiud to poor Lsdy Wilde, and for long allowed her a hundred a year. Oscar never allowed his mother any fixed inoomd, and when he was in all the luxury of his vicious life she has sat in her house with the gas cut off, as she could not pay for its consumption. Mrs Oacar Wilde used to send the unfortunate lady dinner from her own table, b2tween two plates. I was told to-day that Mrs Prank Leslie had made friends with Willio, and that they had mutually agreed to let the little epiaode of their marriage drop into oblivion. The Ladies' Kennel Association held its initial exhibition in the beautiful grounds of llmuleigh Club, on the banks of the Thames. The association is in its infancy, but it already h\a nearly 700 members, among them the Princess ©f Wales, who bad several onferits, and took prizes. Her Royal Highness is a great dog lover, and owns many valuable specimens of various breeds. The exhibition was entiraly got up snd managed by ladies, and it went off without a hitch. It was- a ""smatt"" function, the P.iocess attend ing with her daugbte's, and the Pru.co also.

297,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,224,The Strangest Insect in the World.,"The aweto, as the Maoris or natives of New Zealand call it, or Hipialis virescens, as natu ralists term it, is found in New Zealand, and Is a vegetable caterpillar of from 3in to 4in in length, and, so far, science has not been able to say whether it is a vegetable ot an insect. It is alwAjs found at the foot of large myrtle trees that have beautiful red flowers oa their stems, and a beautiful creeping, clematis as white as the snow. The Maoris call this tree by the name of ista. Tbe aweto buries itself among the loots of the rata, a few inches above the ground, and tbeie lives until it is full grown, when it undergoes a most wonderful change. The spore of a vegetable fungus, termed by naturalists Sopboerlaßobertsii, fastens itself to the neck of the caterpillar, juet between tbe head and the first ring, and then grows upwards to the height of from 6!n to Bin. Many people assert tbat there is never more than one stem, but such is not the case, for some nave been found with two stems, although very rarely. The stem shoots up out of the ground, above where the caterpil lar is living, about 2in or 3in; below the ' earth it grows into tbe aweto, until it fills up every possible space within the outer skin without changing the form of the insect in • the slightest way whatsoever, but simply substituting a vegetable matter for animal matter. As soon as,this takes place both the plant and tbe caterpillar become dry and hard and die, but retain exactly tho same ■ form as when alive. The whole ba9 a brown colour, and the insect appears a wooden caterpillar, with a hpge horn standing up from the back of its neck. How the cater pillar manages to propagate its species no one can tell. Usually the caterpillar be comes a chrysalis, the chrysalis changes into a motb, tbe moth lays eggs, und the&e eggs again become caterpillars, and so on without Btopping. Many reasons are given why the plant Bhoots up from the back of the neck of tbe aweto. One is tbat the aweto has a slimy substance cozing out from its neck, which, while tbe aweto is boring at tbe foot of the rata tree for its only food, catches the seed of the fucgus and holds it fast there till the latter begins to grow. When it has sucked all the vegetable life out of the ~ aweto it must naturally die, for it finds no further nourishment. The aweto is often found in large numbers. —Public Opinion.",0,-1.220945786,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

275,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,202,MY IMPRESSIONS OF IRELAND.,"It — INTRODUCTORY — THE PEOPLE — Ire land's Curse : The Potato— Dublin, Stationary — Belfast, Progressive. I question very much whether there is another ' country- in the Queen's broad that has supplied material in suob inexhaustible store for controversial Writing in oar day as the Emerald Isle. I believe I might safely go farther and say that there is no other country or people on which even now such a welter of confused and dashing opinion exists. Suppose I take myself and my own ex perience as an illustration of the case of the average colonial. I bad read almost every thirg worth read- Ing on the subject. From Froade I got one Bet of opinions ; from Lecky another of an opposite, though not of an extreme, ten dency; from Carlyle much that THsagreed with both ; and from Mitchell and others of his Echool a picture of Irish virtue and per fection, with a background of Saxon treachery and brutality that upset and dis arranged all my grouped and classified con clusions, and took me back hopelessly to the point whenoe I bad eet out on my voyage of historical exploration. The sum of it all was that my opinions on Irelacdand the Irish were chaotic, variable, and cos Stating. .1 certainly did not believe, as many people teem to do, that every Irishman was born with a doable dose of original sin, or that the human atrocity with the features of a pig, tha leer of an idiot, the club and the whisky bottle, with which we are familiar in the English and American comic paper?, was a fair type of the average Irishman at home. Yet must I confess to a dimly censcioue feeling that there was in the national charac ter some hereditary weakness, some indefin able shortcoming, that defied the beat inten tions of the statesman, much as some un familiar and secret disease defies the expul sive skill of the physician. Perhaps I may be wrong. Who can claim infallibility of opinion where the Irish question is the sub ject of speculation ? Bnt there was one point, one conclusion, on which no doubt or indecision assailed me. That was that the civil and religious govern ment of the country — the one operating from without, the other from within; the one working on the bodies, the other on the mieds and consciences of the people — aould both claim in equal shares whatever intellec tual and moral stagnation had settled on the country. This, as nearly as possible, describes my attitude of mind when, in accordance with my programme of travel, I decided on clos ing my recent wanderings abroad with A. RAMBLE THROUGH THE EMERALD ISLE. A sojourn in Dublin lorger than a diligent 24 boars is not needed to -inform the intelli gent traveller that the Industrial history of that city is written If gibly aoross its face. Whifrkj is the essence of its commercial life, and the production of Guinness's porter its highest achievement in industrial art. The great chimney "" stalks "" of the distilleries and breweries can ba seen from every point of the city, towering high in mid air, side by side almost, in strange companionship, with the lofty church spires that proclaim the munificence of the lords of the liquor trade. The wealthy Guinness family spent a king's ransom on the restoration of St. Patrick's Protestant Cathedral, of which Swift was at one time dean ; one of the Roses, of whisky making fame, in a fit of splendid piety, lavished a quarter of a million on Christ Church ; the memory of the D'Arcys and the Jamkeons is also solidly perpetuated in the religious architecture of the city, and there is Ecarcely a Catholic temple from James's Gate to the Pigeon House Fort .in which one may not see some florid memento of the benevolence of a departed publican. Except, perhapp, bank directors, meditat ing an illegal exercise of their authority, there are no representatives of wealth at Home whose religion takes so ostentatious a form as that of the people engaged in the manufacture of liquor ; and nowhere that I have been have I seen so many notable illus trations of this characteristic as in the Irish capital. Oataide the great liquor interests, the in dustrial and commercial life of the city is of the most huckstering and inconsequential kind. It resembles Edinburgh in being a city of shopkeepers, but, unlike the "" Modern Athens,"" it has no bustling port of Leith at his doors, itß maritime trade being of the most modest dimensions. Those on whom its shopkeeping existence principally de pends represent at once the least useful and the most pretentious, the neediest and yet the most spendthrift and most objectionable elements in the social and national life of the country. These consist of the small landholding classes, half-pay military and police officers, shoals of pensioned Govern ment officials, and a professional aristocracy of lawyers and doctors. Need it be said that among such classes, with their peculiar traditions of superiority and their beggarly pride of ancestry, all the small, mean, and offensive accomplish ments of snobbery are assiduorfsly cultivated. They constitute in themselves a distinct and Beparate community, holding contemptuously alool from thoee around them, entirely want ing in national pride or patriotic feeling, and opposed to everything that aims at changing a system of Government of which they are at once the oat ward embodiment and the chief beneficiaries. The descent to the multitude— to the gwarms of wretchedly-paid mechanics and labourers — is steep and the way hard. The export trade of the city is insignificant-, and all its larger wants — those things that speak of manufacturing and industrial enterprise —are supplied from abroad. The logic of all this is obvious. It tells of a condition of in ternal impoverishment and decay, for which it is doubtful whether ~a remedy can be found merely In legislative change, however iweeping or extensive. Those with whom I conversed on the sub ject—men who had taken a large share in the disposal of public and national affairs — looked to the introduction of a protective policy as the only means of vitalising the flickering spirit of industrial enterprise and developing whatever natural resources the country possessed. That, I was told, was one of tho central features of Mr Parnell's conception of a self-governing Iceland. I am not concerned here about recording Incidents of travel, and there are few countries that furnish such material in the same abundanoe as Ireland does; neither am I intent on reproducing my impressioss of the towns and the country and people, only in so far as such matters may be neces sary to an understanding of the political, social, and industrial condition of the country. I may, however, say that, to my mind, a general picture of Irish life to-day, as it may be seen In the cities and in tho rural districts, would not be a work on which one could look with unmixed pleasure. There is a good deal that Is wildly, grotesquely extravagant in the popular esti mate of Irish life and character. I saw nowhere any evidence of the existence of the traditional stage Irishman of comic history — tho ragged, battered, devil-may-care creature whose humour is generally a com pound of bad whisky and idiocy. I did, however, ace day by day a Btrange com mingllng""of humour and pathos — a bleeding of poverty and pride, of sadness and mirth, sufferiag and. fortitude, of dependence and dignity and general nobility of character ' such as could not possibly exist under similar circumstances in any. other country or among any other people I have had the opportunity of observing. It seemed to me at the same time that, sublime as these qualities admittedly are, they are a Bource of weakness as well as strength in the character of the people. To me the existence of such qualities under such circumstances spoke of a spirit of tranquil, helpless submission to conditions of life that would drive any other white Tace at the pre sent day into revolt and resistance against every itiflueßce that either compelled or counselled resignation to such a life. Patience and rags, contentment and hunger may constitute a fine picture of religious per fection ; but experience and observation tell us that such qualities are no more a proof of intelligent religious feoliDg than they are of a rational and laudable desire for individual comfort and advancement. I had often heard and read a good deal of "" Irish discontent,"" but the conviction sank deep into my mind that precisely what is wanted is more discontent of the active, persistent, and intelligent kind— discontent accompanied with steady and sensible resolve and solidity of purpose. As rogardß the cities and towns, public buildings and such matters, I shall Bay bnt little. The truth- is that outside of Dublin and Belfast there is little to speak of bnt desolation and decay. The country has the finest seaboard in tbo world perhaps ; there are harbours— natural harbours — of the most magnificent kind in profusion ; but they are empty and sileint. They scarcely serve any other purpose beyond that of allowing of the shipment to other countries of the food supplies that the people raise, but are too poor to use themselves. In this resDecb some remarks made to me by an Irish gentleman on the subject of th 9 national food of the psople may be worth repeating. "" The introduction of the potato,"" said he, "" was the biggest curse that ever fell upon this country. Instead of banishing the snake?, if St. Patrick had banished the culti vation of the potato he'd be a real bene factor to this unfortunate country. It's been a bigger curse than Strongbow or Cromwell or the Prince of Orange or any of the other bloodthirsty Sassenacbs that we spend more than half our time cursing."" His explanation was that if the mass of the small farmers and the poor people gene rally could grow sufficient potatoes to supply their daily wants they are content. Neither their ambition, their ideals of comfort or good living, nor their conception of duty take them beyond the limit of a decent potato supply. "" Had the potatoes shared the fate of the snakes,"" said this amusing but per fectly serious and candid Irishman, ""the whole history of Ireland to-day would have to be rewritten. Instead of waiting, abori ginal-like, on Providence and the potato patch, the people would be compelled to develop whatever inventive or mechanical faculties the Almighty endowed us with, and rise like other nations to a decent level in the world. Either that or die decently at once, and not be doing it by degrees, as we have been these hundreds of years."" Of Dublin architecturally there is not much to go into raptures over. It is in many respects a delightful city. Its greatest pride is certainly not its public architecture, nor its buiidinga or its monuments. But it has many noble thoroughfares and handsome squares ; its suburban beauties linger long in the memory, its park and its gardens are marvels of loveliness, and its daughters are the brightest, the most winsome, and the moat charmiog I looked on during the course ef my travels abroad. Trinity College is the great seat of learn ing, not only in Dublin, but in Ireland. All the greatest men the country have produced were educated in Trinity. On each side of its great entrance gates statues have been raised to the memory of Burke and Goldsmith, two of its most distinguished scholars. Not far off, but outside the college precincts, the memory of Tom Moore is perpetuated in bronze — a sadly-discoloured and unpictur egque representation of the pleasure-loving bard of Ireland. Not far off King William, of ""pious and immortal memory,"" be strides a caracoling steed in "" monu mental brass""; and in the shadow of the Irish Parliament House a sculp tured figare of Smyth O'Brien stands on a granite pedestal, pointing grimly with out stretched hand to the building which Irish men still continue to dream of as the Home Rule Parliament of the future. Bat may it not be that, In that time, Belfast, in every thing bub the name, will usurp the metro politan claims of the present capital city? At the time of my visit it nearly equalled Dublin In population, and, speaking from appearances, more than equalled it in wealth and material prosperity. Its rise and pro gress form one of the pleasantest and most Instructive chapters in the industrial history of Ireland. It Is beyond doubt the great ! commercial and industrial centre of Ireland, Its docks and its shipping remind one of i Newcastle, Leith, or Hartlepool, and its gteat shipbuilding woiks on ""The Island"", are equal to anything that even the Oljde can show\ (To be continued.)",0,-1.260239045,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some year 6 ago, it i=» mentioned, a prominent miller aud farmer in Keniucky used bran as a ferti liser, and the results were astonishing, hiß yield bring 55 bushols per acre. This year, Mr John R'chards, of Nollin, Hardin Counbry, produced 55£ bushels per acre of magnificent whea l "", and ou it being learned thai be had used bran a? a fertiliser he was written to for information on tin subject. Iv his reply, Mr RicharJs saya he has bscn experimenting with different hfuds or fertilisers for 25 years in the hope of raising 50 bushela of wheat per acre, and that he has ab last suc ceeded, but that ha had never done so until he used brau as a fertiliser. The quality of the wheat is also greatly improved, ib being very much heavier than any he has ever raised before. Rich soil needs less than poor soil, and he siys that 12001b of bran per acre ia the proper amount to use on good land, while from 15001b to 20001b on thin land ia the correct amount. The bran should be sown broad cast and harrowed in about three weeks be fore reading time ; this will give the brau time to decompose and become absorbed by bhe soil. The bran should nsver be drilled iv with tha seed. Mr R'chards assert ethat bhe banefit to the crops from bhe use of bran is very much more lasting than from any oijher fertili ser, and that the resU'ti are almost as good the second year as the ficst Bab the best plan would be to use the quantity in-licatid abovo the first veur, and a smaller quantity, say one half, the second and each succeeding year. If similar results could he obtained in this country, bran at Melbourne prices — 6d a bushel, or £2 10 1 par ton — ought to be good value aa a ferti liser.

299,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,226,HEALTH COLUMN.,"The Boast of Health. All doctors know that just before death the patient often experiences what is called a "" rally,"" Nature making apparently her last stand against the symptom which we call death ; and it is quite likely that the feeling which induoes men to boast of health is of the same kind — an effort of Nature to protect us against the coming Bickness which the body has recognised, though the mind has not. The phenomenon occurs every day in the cases of consumptive patients, who brighten up and grow hopeful ju9t when the disease is about to strike its hardest blows, and it is quite possible that it is more frequent than has yet been recognised that the approach of fever, for example, is signalled by an unusual consciousness of health. "" I have never felt so well in my life,"" cays the patient, who 24 hours after is lying pro- Btrate, and whose friends quote his statement as illustrating once more the ancient and depressing belief. The boast had nothing to do with the ill ness, but it preceded it, and men, attracted by the violent contrast, instinctively link the two together as in some way and to some extent cause and effect. — Spectator. Relief to the Eyes.— A medical journal says that in tbe continued use of the eyes in such work as Bewing, tjpe-setting, book keeping, reading, and studying, the saving point is looking up from the work at short intervals and looking around the room. This practised every 10 or 15 minutes relieves the mu?cular tension, rests the oyes, and makes the blood supply much better. Value of a Good Digestion.— One of the greatest mistakes Bbout food which people make is to forget that the true value of food to anybody is the measures of ita digesti bility. Half a pound of cheese is vastly more nourishing, as regards its mere composiiion, than half a pound of beef ; but, while the beef will be easily digested, and thus be of vast service, the cheese is put out of court altogether for some folk by reason of its difficult digestibility. The Incubation Period in Diph thehia — Recent Investigations are said to have shown that the usual incubation period in diphtheria cases does not exceed four days, and that it is oftecer two days than any other period, while seven days may be set as the outside limit.

The snow, which lay on the flats to a d>'pth. of sin or Gin and on the hiils up to 15in or more, has b?en a very unwelcome guest, and has put a stop 1 to nearly all outdoor work. We have a'so experienced extremely cold winds at times, accompanied by the severest frosts known, here for many years. So far as I can learn, the oldest ""identity"" in this bush doe 3 not remember such a long succession of. winter ■weather since the year 1868, if even. then. A lot of snow is lying all over the district yet, and I Believe theto is more to come. Dining a resi dence of more^thon SO jears in. various paits of Otago I have? not known such astvtre winter. Calves —Since my previous remarks about the calves which were whey-fed in this district last year, many of them have died,, and there are more to follow. I wish to impress upon Bottlers the necessity for more suitable foud, even at any 00Bt, for farmers must rear their best heifer calves if they are to k< ep good stork, and a balf-fed beast is much nioro likely to ""kick the bucket"" than fill it. I hope to sea the calves betfcrdone for in the future, for the benefit of both "" man and beast,"" aud that tho expsrience of the past may bear good fruit hereafter. Babbit. Poison.— The settlers here have re ceived notice to poison rabbit?, and I am in formed that the directors of the ttatanui Dairy Factory Association have made arrangements ■whereby those in need can obtain the iu-ccssaTy stuff at c st prica. Incidentally, as showing how early the season for increase is here, T may men tion that one of our schoolboys found a nest of young rabbits oVout a week old en the 30th July. It is quite amubing to read in the Witness about the thousands of rabbits thifting camp while the snow covers the Mackenzie rabbit-proof (?) fences. Seeing that the rabbits will now stock the Country on. the other side of the fence,_ I have been wondering which is of the most service — the fence, tbe rabMts, or the snow. Work —Most men here could do without this if they had money, but when they bave neither, as I am afraid ia only tco tiue in many c>scs, it ia a ferious matter. Remunerative employment haa not bean so scarce here for years past as at the present time. ""Your own"" Hke3 to ccc men earn as much as they can, without the dictation of our "" glorious Government"" as to how much or in how many hours. Some time ago men woik intj on Government, contracts weie tuld by an official that 3s a day was enough for a man to earn. How is this, I ask, alongside the fact thtt for the pa&t two months paen have not averaged half that amount ? A little more Government dictum, and we shall have to ask what we are to eat and drink, or with what we shall be clothed— i£we do not have to beg thes9 necessaries. Hun -dreds oV men never knew what it was to be out of work a week until the present Government came in'o power, but nuw the average ms»n has to cringrf and crawl for the little he does get, snd that littlv is only about half paid for. Ir-Fi.UENZii. — We are happily free from this ConrplaiDt at present: and are pleased to note that ojir member, Mr T. Mackenzie, is again convales cent. I hope there is none of the la grippe microbe iv the bundle of nswepapera he kindly sent your corre.-pond^nt. Timber. — The Ovv»ka correspondent of the Free Pros of L.st is-sue very justly comments on the injustice of Government psying 4a for West Coast silver piue sleepers while the bu^hmen at O-.vaka are only receiving 2s 9J for totira heartwood. The"" latter price may be an ""existing,"" but cer tainly not a "" living,"" wage. Writing about this suggests a few words in favour of kamai, or kamai lirch timber, particularly 'now that there is co much hting done, and more said, about ""timber for pay ng piupf-sesi For p.-sfs this tiu.br, b>st picked, i< good for 30 or 15 years ; •wlvr-ls- se;ond class, or you;.g and quickly grown, will not fctand five year 3. A few days Eince the writ or saw a lata tree Oft in diameter and some EOft bigh grubbed out by the roots. On examina tion it was found' that the tree had been growing •whei'e there had once been a kamai, and a num- Ber of roots of that timber were found under neath it as sound as any timber in the bush. There was not a ve&ttee of kamai to bs seen on the surface, either trunk or stun-p, but under ground all the main roots were sound as evur. Tfcis proves conclusively that for underground purposes, especially where there is constant moisture, kamai is a valuable timber, and there is an almost unlimited quautity in this bush. I presume there is as much, felled and wasted here each year as would pave all the streets of Ijnndon. Kamai is- of very little value for buil ling pur pi.-*-8. Another Recohd. — Apropos of the recoul of the school committee mentioned in the Witness who cbo^e a teacher because he was thought to be a Presbyterian and turned out a backslider, the following might be classed as second best. A few yeais ago the s-hool committee at a place not a thousand mile 3 from where this is written, being in need of a dominie, a number of applica tions were submitted to them for recommenda tion Amongst the applicants, whose certificates varied in grade from about D 2 downwards, was one who had not a shadow of a certificate, and was entirely unknown to the committee, but— thry picked him. Assault. — From ""information received' I tliiuk there is trouble in store for the cowardly bully who administered a teirible black eye to a helpless boy a few days since. May he get his desert. Concert and Dance — Nextweeklhopetobeable to givea good accountof this entertainment, which i* t> take place on August 9, in aid of a fiddle and fife band. As a rule such meetings in this dU tr'rct i-rc la>gely attended aud pleasantly con ducted. With the exception of over much quiz zing by one or two regular attendants thejftis not much fault to find. Too much quizzing, accompanied by ungenerou3 remarks, makes matters unpleasant With a little im provement in this line our sprees, for a country place, will be hard to beat. Accidents. — I omitted to mention in my last an accident which occurred some time ago to Mrs IrviDe, the wife of a settler near Catlin T s Bridge, by which her leg was broken in two places. So fer as I can bear she is progressing favourably. — Sir B. Warnock a few days since met with an accident which m'ght have been much worse only that ho has a-hard nut to crack. A log fell on him, stunning him for 6ome minutes. Since then he has got a nasty cut on his shit, which will take some time to heal — Another accident occurred to Mr F. Carlton while playing football at Romahapa, he having got a bad split between two of his fingers. Football must be a rather rough game for young men about 20 years of age, 6ft in height, and 12st in weight. Mr Carlton, sen., whose shoulder a while ago was injured by an accident, is now about as sound as ever.

The meat retains its ap pearance and, it is said, its quality. Several joints preserved on May 2, kept their sweet ness and juiciness, and, tothenon-professional eve, looked almost as fresh as meat killed a couple of days previously. If the process rea lises reasonable expectations it will revolu tionise the dead meat export trade. A side of mutton has been sent to China to be tested on return, and meanwhile its fellow side has been retained in Sydney. The latter at pre sent appears to be in excellent condition. A lot of the meat has besn forwarded to Tahiti. It is claimed that 1000 carcases can be pre served for a few shilling?, and an obvious advantage is that as soon as discharged from a steamer the joints can be cut and bung for, it is averred, almost any length of time.",0,-1.298300916,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
270,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,197,THE SIN OF JACQUES.,"The red light from the lamp suspended above the kneeling figure revealed the short, white blouse and the coarse shoes of the labourer. Tbe priest went quietly into the confessional. ""Monsieur father, I have not confessed for 25 years, not since I left the country. You know how it is here in Paris. Bat now I have something on my conscience too heavy to be borne alone, so I must confess it to you, my father. lam a murderer."" "" Confess,' my son ;' the mercy of God is Infinite."" ""Listen, then, to the whole story,"" said the man. ""I am a mason, and I came to Paris' about 20 years ago with a man who had been my companion from childhood. His name was Philip ; mine was Jacques. ""He was handsome; I was always clamsy. There was no better workman than ho, while I. was always a bungler. He was kind and generous to everyone. Once here in the oity we had the good luck to be employed by the same man, but in the evenings lie left me alone most of the time ; he went out to amuse himself with his comrades. Tbat was natural at his age. I had to be stingy, for I had to support my old mother in the country, and I sent her all my savings. 1 took my meals at the fruit woman's where I lodged. But the woman was a poor widow, and I saw that I helped her ; besides, I had fallen in love with her daughter. I lived there three years without being able to tell her of my love for her. As I said before, I was a bungling workman, and could barely earn enough for myself. After a time my mother died. Then I was able to save something for myself. I told Catherine of my love. At first she didn't say yes or no. She consulted her mother, however, who respected me as an honest, sober man, and the marriage was arranged. Now tbat she bad promised to be my wife I wanted Philip to know of my happiness, so I told him. Perhaps you can guess the rest, my father. "" Philip was handsome and amiable — all, in fact, that I was not, and without meaning to do it, he made Catherine fall in love with him. It was her birthday, and as a gift for the occasion I had bought a little gold trinket. We were alone. I took the box from my pocket, and, opening it, showed her my gift. She burst into tears and said : "" ' Forgive me, Jacques, and keep that for the woman yon marry. I can never be your wife, for I love someone else. I love Philip."" ""What could I do, as I loved them both ? Only what I thought would be for their happiness. As Philip had no money, I lent him my savings to buy furniture. "" Well, they were married, and everything went well for a time. They had a little boy, and I was his godfather. I named him Cimille, after my mother. Soon after his birth Philip began to change. You live among the poor, and know by heart the story of the labourer who, little by little, falls into the habit of drinking, who stays away from home wasting his time, and finally gets to abusing and beating his wife. In less than two years Philip had come to this. "" I had too much love for Catherine and little Camille to lose sight of them entirely. On Saturday nights, when I knew that Philip was out drinking, I walked around by their house, met the child, and by questioning him found out how things were going, and if they were in want. ""Years passed. Philip grew worse and worse. Their son was 20 years old ; his mother worshipped him. We had had him educated. He had learned to draw, and was apprenticed to an architect. ""But last night when I met him I saw something was wrong. "" ' What is the matter 1 ' I asked. ""•Last night,' he' said, *I had to draw to see whether or not I must enter the army, and I <drew No. 10, which sends me to die of fever in the colonies, and means an absence of at least five years. I must leave my mother alone with my father. She will die!' "" I passed a dreadful night. Think of it I The result of 20 years. In the morning I was bowed down like an old man. I went to my work on a house we were building on the Arago boulevard. No matter how much a man suffer?, he must work just the same, you know. So I climbed up to the scaffold ing — we had reached the fourth storey — and began to lay bricks. Presently some one touched me on the shoulder. It was Philip 1 "" I hadn't seen him for a long time, and I hardly knew him. "" ' Well,' said 1, 'so your boy drew the un lucky number.' ""•What of it? 1 said he, with a vicious look. 'Are yon, too, going to torment me about that along with Catherine and Oamille 1 The boy must do as others do, serve his country. Parbleu 1 I know well what they think. If I was dead he wouldn't have to go. So much the worse for them. lam still solid on my feet, and Camille isn't a widow's son.' "" A widow's son I The murderous thought came to me as I heard the words and seethed in my brain all the morning while I was working beside him. Eleven o'clock struck, and the men went down to the ground to their dinner. Philip and I were the last to go. As he stepped on the rung of the ladder he called up to me maliciously : "" ' You see I bave the step of a sailor. Ha 1 Camille in far from being a widow's son 1 ' "" The hot blood flaw to my brain. I seized the ladder with my two hands, and calling out ' I will make him one 1 ' I flung it out into space. ""He was killed instantly, and everyone thought it was an accident.

383,1892-05-31,HBH,Hawke's Bay Herald,21,CARL HERTZ AND THE EMPIRE COMPANY.,"To-morrow night Carl Hertz and the Empire Company, now touring New Zealand under engagement to Mr George Musgtove, will open in the Theatre Koyal to-morrow evening. Carl Hertz ia the wonderful illusionist who till recently was setting London, Paris, Vienna, and .Berlin into a fervor of amazemont and excitement. He has maoy very notable illusions. His two moat startling ones are ""Stroabaika"" and ""Aerolithe,"" Iv the first a man, after being Identified by a committee, ia nnder their supervision manacled to a board suspended in full view oi the audience. There is no con nection between the nnder side of the board and the stage, and by its upper side it Is only connected by the supports npon which it swings. After the man is locked to the board tbe curtains are drawn for a few seconds, nnd then with drawn, when it io found that a lady has taken the place of a man, wbo walks on to the stage from another part of the theatre. ""Aerolithe"" is another wonderful per formance. A young lady walks on to the stßge and bows. Carl Hertz places his hands nnder her feet, lifts her up into tbe air, and taking away his hands be leavea her supported upon vacancy. Apparently the air is solid to her, for she walks, jumps, turns somersaults, skips through a hoop, &c. In addition to these, and to It host ot other smaller but .tsitliug feats, Carl Herts bas yet another brace of ""startlers."" The first of these is named 'LeCocon."" To a taps stretched ncros^ 'he stage is suspended nn empty box. -uch as a man's clothes are sent home iv from tbe tailor's. On the paper bottom Mr Hertz draws the rough outline ot o silkworm. As he talks the transforma tion takes place, and the cocoon bursts Ihrough the paper and swings from the tape. Ib is of silk, and as big as a good | sized toy balloon. From thia evolves a lovely face, then the bust and the woman is complete. The other illusion, ""The Pho-nix,"" represents a woman apparently burnt to ashes in view of the audience. The other members of the combination consist of Ml_ Rose Dearing, sonbrette actress and vocalist from the principal London theatres ; Mr Fred Mason, eccentrio musical comedian from the London Albnmbra, and the celebrated danoing quartette, ""The Fairy Four,"" who caused such a furore in England during the last season.

157,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,84,CROMWELL.,"August 3.— The hackneyed and essentially British mbject, the weather, is occupying much attention lately. The snowstorms of last week did not visit this district, and while the low country has been swept by snowstorms we have bean levelling in bright sunny weather with keen frosts at niehi The rivera are going down rapidly, and both Chinamen and Europeans are taking their stations along the river binks wailing for a further fall. Unfortunately, however, a thaw seems to have set in, in which case farewtll to the prospect of a golden harvest from the river. Bands Contest. — An effort is being made by a Cromwell society to promote a bands contest, limited to country ban^s, to be held at Cromwell next March. Mr D. O. Jolly is president of the association, and Mr W. D. Jolly secretary. The proi*o~ed competition is to be limited to the following bands: — Cromwell, Bannockburn^ Nevis, llawea, Blacks School Band, Matakanui, Roxburgh, Tapanui, and one or two other country baivis that have never competed at a conte-t. Moupy for prizes is to be raised locally, aud the bands are to be divided into three classes. It is intended to have no ""sight"" te*t, which is rather a mistake, and will to a great extent defeat the object of the proposed contest, which is to en courage and increase the proficiency of country bands. The-sigUt tost need not be a difficult one, but could be graded to the assumed capacity of the band. If there be no tight test a band may g'ind away at two or thiee pieces until as pertert as po^tible in them witnout gaining much practice or greatly enlarging its knowledge of music. . ■ Dead Iloitsn. — The expression ""working out a dead horse"" may ba familiar to most of your leaders ; it meaus working for your creditor or creditors in order to extiuguish your liability. Professor Montagu, ventriloquist and conjuror, wh) is playing a season in Cromwell, had to work out a deaa horse in a diff-rent manner. A horse of his died in Cromwell, and he engaged a man to bury it. The funeral rite* and the burial ground were the same as is usual in the case of horses dying in Cromwell — the carcase was droppei over a face of rocks into the 'Clulha. Owiug, however, to the lownesss of tbe river, the carcase was not swept away. Pioceediugs were taken against the protessor by the police, but th 9 case was disrnis-.ed.

332,1876-07-15,THA,Thames Advertiser,19,REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR IN NEW ZEALAND. Part LIX.,"TAUPO campaign- (continued). Captain St. Geobge also addressed them, and then all retired for the night, each one choosing.as soft a spot of ground as he could find. Brave St. George slept, well (his last sleep on'earth), but McDonnell was too anxious about the movements of Eepa's force, particularly as he had seen the flash of a match on the other side of the lake, which net of folly : McDonnell viciously remarked could only . come from Hawke's Bay. Before sun rise the force had breakfasted and com menced their march. They soon rounded the lake, and reached the village of Papakai, ~when, to- the Colonel's surprise and annoyance, he found Eopa only just arrived, instead of being, as he should have, at tho rear of Pourere. Eopa and Captain McDonnell (the colonel's brother) explained the reason, the Napier natives having hindered the march as much as possible • because their prophet had foretold some serious disaster would happen. McDon hell now walked up; to fienata, and asked him the reason of his extraordinary con- v duct.. His reply amused everyone, for ■ he evidently wished to show off beforo the other chiefs. He said, that ha had given '■""■ orders for a halt, and wished to have ; breakfast. That he was going to take ; tho direction of affair's, and after food was cooked he would send an herald with this (producing the rusty hopper of a steel flour mill to use as a trumpet) to summon - tho enemy (o surrender. That he would .. give them one day to think of it, and if they would not give in he would then con sider tho best plan to adopt to make them do so. While Benata was disclosing -his intentions, McDonnell seeing the futility of contesting the point with such an ob stinate old savage, rapidly formed'ah'other : plan, which he proceeded immediately to ■'.; put into execution, Eenata and his 300 ; men knew that nothing could be done satisfactorily without them,: and thought they had the game in their hands, so McDonnell said nothing, but rather . seemed to agree with him.- He then strolled off towards St. George and the !' Arawas. The village of-Papakai con- ■ sisted of a long row of huts on the edge ■ of the bush that fringed the tableland from ' which Tongariro rose. To the front and - left, was .a perfectly level. country for about two miles, when the Iwituaroa : range is reached, and on some, table land at the bottom Te Eooti pa (Pourere) was situalo. Our men had began to coot their food in the usual'native oven,. Wanganui and the Europeans.on the right, Ngalikahunguna in the centre, the Arawas,. on the left. McDonnell found St, George . at the latter camp, and taking him apart, ;. iotormed him of Benata's behaviour and what he now intended to do, which St. George cordially agreed. to, for after Mc- Donnell left he called out some of tho young fellows and got them to go with him on tho plain to have a look at tho pa, and he kept them engaged while McDonnell went to the Wan ganuis, who, after explaining Mt plans quietly to Colonel Herrick 1 , called' out, ""The Arawas are off to tho pa! quick, or you will be cut out! Away! mount the hill, and got on the ■ table land, the Europeans shall go with :-. you."" Wanganui rose like one man, never should an Arawa be before them. Tatua, tatua (""arm, arm"") was the cry, and they dashed. through the bush,-audv mounted the table land. :: St; George-- waited until he saw them moving in the direction of the pa, when he suddenly shouted out,."" Titero ki Wanganui (look, at the Wanganuis), they are going to de prive us of the credit of the day! they are going to take the pa'.""The young Arawas looked, and without more to do, led by: St. George, made straight for the pa, keeping parallel with the Wanganuis who were on the plateau above, them.. McDonnell/ seeing the success of his plans then-went. to Renata, and, with an appearance of great innocence,said, ""I thoughtyouhad given orders not to attack the pa to-day! ; Have you. changed.your mind about the:/ white flag and the mill hopper ?""' "" No',""; replied.the chief. ""Very:well,"" said ' McDonnell,"" Wanganui and the Arawas are off to take it, and I am going to fol low."" Benata looked for a moment at the Colonel, and felt h6 had been out ,wilted, and accepted his defeat,- one"" thought only seemed to possess him—that he and his men must not allow Te Kooti to be beaten without their help. He seized his rifle 'calling out, ""0 tribe! collect them, Colonel.. Ane!; ane!- : (alas, alas). 0 .tribe, [quick! quick;!"" and tho old fellow hurried ,on his tribe to the scene of action; -'! 0, Colonel,"" said he,' ""lit's all through that prophet—Henare's poropiti!'! and then in a fit'of intense ox-.; asperation shouted,"" Humbug the_poro piti!"" for ihe-old .man was hot wanting in pluck. The enemy seeing the Arawas advancing, sent a party to take possession of the high ground, over which Eepa and his men were marching unseen by them, and. had; just opened"" a sharp fire on the •- left flank of the Arawas, when, to their in tense astonishment, they found themselves.-,. assailed by the Wanganuis in such rough : fashion that they had to beat a hasty re- '. treat across the river, followed by our men like a pack of hounds. Wiuiata, as •- usual, killed the first man, and two others were left by the retreating Hauhaus. Meanwhile the Arawa and Taupo men were not idle. They waded the river and carried a-small earthwork used as a piqnet station by Te Kooti, and killed a few of his men. "" McDonnell and some of Renata's people now came up and joined in the attack. Wangauni pressing for ward, separated info two, parlies; one under Wirihana attacked Te'Hauhau's ■ pa, while'the main body under Eepa dashed up the hill for Te Rooti's pa, Winiata and Turei leading. : St. George seeing the stato of things, and that Wan ganui would take no denial, called on his men to surround the pa, and away they went in hot pursuit of. Wanganui/ and in a moment two sides of the redoubt were lined with our men, who began to fire through tho loopholes, tho enemy gaining little protection from the parapet, which.,was..at least eight feet.. high and four thick. Winiata with-his ; usual coolness thrust his arm into one of the loopholes, and, seizing the muzzle of a ; rifle, dragged it through by main force beforo the owner had time to fi.ro it off.

Some rascals are devoting themselves to the destruction of cricket pitches. Re cently a suburban club had its ground ruined for the season, and now it has been discovered that the pitch'prepared on the Basin Reserve for the Australian match has been destroyed, the turf being torn up and holes made in the ground in all directions. As the playing area is none too large it will not be easy to provide another good pitch at short notice. It is stated that Mr G. Fisher intends to contest the Guy in the Government interest. Mr A.

129,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,56,THE MINING INDUSTRY.,"TO THE EDITOR. Sir,— At the risk of being called a bore, I venture to make a suggestion for the considera tion of those who take an interest in this important industry, which has been a grea!; factor in making New Zealand, and which offers a permanent panacea for the unemployed. Ib is this : to bore prospectiog holes for leads, river beds, and lodes, with properly equipped plant, under expert eupervieion. When pay able washdirb or quartz is struck, then companies or syndicates be formed to sink shafts or drive tunnels as required, and carry on mining operations in a thoroughly business manner. It seems to ba the recognised system bo successfully adopted in South Africa, the United States, and now in Aus tralia. On the Coolgardie goldfields alone an enterprising Government have called for tenders to bore by means of diamond drills to a depth of 3000 ft, and surely our Government could undertake simitar operations — say on the same lines as the advances to farmers and settlers, taking special care that all outlay shall be guaranteed recoupment as a firsb charge, or uncalled capital or some other satis f notary form of guarantee. The phenomenal yields now being obtained from the quartz lodes in the Auckland provinoe and tho plucky investments made by Mr David Ziman on the West Coast should stimu late the inhabitants of Otago to bestir them selves. I have before me a copy of the London Financial Times of June 13, and observe quotations of some 300 companies in South Africa and Australia ; four only in all New Zealand— the Hauraki, Waihi, aud Waihi Sil verton in North Island, and the Achilles in Otago Lake district. Surely the time has arrived to wake up, and see if we have nob as good things in the Middle Island as in the North. Only fancy what a stimulus to trade of every class the discovery and opening of a series of mines would prove! — a permanent Eource of wealth, and, under proper conduct and supervision, no more risky than farmiDg or stock-raHng. To bore first and prove the existenoe of payable ores is the safest and surest system to adopt. There are numerous brands of diamond rock drills in daily use— the "" Ingersoll,"" ""National,"" and hosts of others. To simplify the matter and bring ib to business, let tenders be called for, and the cost per foot can be arrived at ; '• the present not overworked Government inspectors of mines to superintend boring operations and be held responsible for the trulh of payable ores beiug discovered, and on whose certificate the investing public may be invited to co - operate. Seeing the avidity with which any really good mine is snapped up in Western Australia by the British investor to the extent of millions of pounds, and daily going on, ib seems as if the people of Otago are mi sing an opportunity of sending away the depression and coming to the front once more as prosperous people. Mosb here have cause to thank the goldmining industry for the prosperity they have and now enjoy. Let them not forsake the bridge which carried them over. Farming is all very well, but for abiding returns and labour-giving employment successful mining takes the cake. If the foregoing arouses public interest and leads to action I shall be proud to ba deemed August 1.

40,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,17,Agricultural Column.,", THE MARSH HARVESTER. We are always glad when we can ' record anything new in the shape of ' machinery or otherwise, calculated to re ! duce the cost of labor, and consequently ' of production in agricultural matters, in > which a large proportion of our readers ■ siw interested. We noM<-e that in Vie- I toria in the last week of Dec-em ber a trial I was made of a new reaping and hindinir > machine. This is known as the Marsh i Flarvester, imported from America, by a , Melbourne firm, and manufactured by i Mess-s Warder, Mrchell and Co.. Ohio. •' This being the first trial made, everything l does not seem to have gone so smoothly as could have been desired, but sufficient was seen to indicate that this machine will prove a most valuable acquisition to the cultivators of 'he soil. With light crops the Harvester at the trial referred to gave entire satisfaction, but some modi fication would be required to render it suitable for heavy crops. The necessary alterations however are very simple and easily effected, and we trust soon to see it at work in Tokomairiro. Regarding the : Harvester the ' Australasian writes: The Marsh Harvester, tried last week, promises to be a most valuable introduc tion. In the first place, when we have men or bids with practice and skill at binding, it will almost t-ike the place of a strictly mechanical reaper and binder, about"" 'the construction of which there must necessarily be a difficulty. It will lie hard to make anyih-ng of"" a simple machine use bands taken from the sti'aw as this is cut, and cords or wire bands are objei-tionaole. A straw or h»y rope may, perhaps, l>e vet applied to this purpose, to be cut off iti lengths, and twisted round each sheaf as required, bur vye have here now h machine likely to save us much future planning and contriving. This has evidently been made for light crops, and Short in"" the straw, as the platform is too short, from front to back, to allow any other to lie upon it. Then a heavy crop would fill up the receptable for the sheaves so quickly that these could not possibly be removed by two men, £>r which number only is there standing-room. Of course this is only a temporary objection, the working parts all admitting alterations in proportion calculated to adapt them to any crop. But tha binding requires to be done very quickly if the reaper is to do a fair share ""of work, aud no little practice will be required to fit men for the task. With a change of m«""n for the landing platform, that is to say, with five men and a pair of horses, seven or eight acres ought to be cut and bound in the day. But if there is any difficulty about binding, the machine contains within it>elf the plan of a simpler, and therefore, better side delivery machine than any we have in use. The seivti-circular tray or receptacle for the sheaves, has only to be made double, and fixed to a pivot to allow of its turning over as each sheaf is collected. The time of turning over can be regulated by the band which carries the endless webb, and, of course, may be varied according to the weight of the crop, so that th 9 sheaves inav be of a convenient size, whether this be liirht or heavy. Without, the tilting trav the delivery would be in one contin uous swathe, but the division into sheaves can be very easily effected. Any system of revolving rakes rau«t needs be far heavier, and more likely to get out of order than the endless web. Another very important point in this machine is the way in which motion is given to the knife bar. The connexion between it and the crank is simply a lever and a long wooden connect ing rod. The lever lies under the plat form, with its short end in a socket on the centre of the knife bar, and its long end attached totho connecting rod behind. Thus any extent of motion or amount of speed can be readily given to the knives by simply altering the proportions of the lever, and all noise is done away with. The knives are light, and cut freely with the first forward movement after a stop page. Altogether the machine is light and well balanced, even when loaded with the two bin hers on an extra platform, and when in motion the work appears very easy to the horses. The plan throughout necessitates the use of but little iron, and should afford. some useful hints to the many makers of reapers here, who are getting into the very bad habit of using far more weight of material than there is any need for. The ' Dunstan Times ' says : — The wea ther of late has been very unsettled, but as a whole the exact thing that was re quired ; the farmers and gardeners are quite jolly at the vast improvements per ceptible in their crops, and expect a most abundant harvest. The miners are equally elated, as the heavy rains that have fallen throughout the district have given them a supply of the liquid element that will suit their purposes for a long time. Some few of the race owners have suffered,"" their races having been swept away, but alto gether we may assume the benefit to the district from the rain will exceed the injury sustained. Speaking of the scarcity of harvest labour, the ' Bendgo Advertiser ' mentions that in some instances the men refuse to do a stroke of work until they are pro mised the exborbitant price of L 8 per week or so and rations. "" Some of our farmers, who have become sufficiently strong, have reaping-machines, and can, in a manner, dispense with a great deal of labor, but then somebody must be got to bind the sheaves, and there, they are met by the men, who keep up an exhor bitant price. If in the case of these agriculturists matters are so bad; what must it be with free selectors and farmers just making a start ? It must be absolute ruin. A man in such a posi:ion, not won derfully »flush of money, must sell his crop as soon as possible, and thus not be able to wait and get a good price, paying so much for clearing the land, so much for ploughing, preparation, and seed, fencing, &c, and then giving his laborers such prices when be will he able to get »nly some 3s or 4s per bushel for the wht-at ! It is almost an utter impossi bility for him to make even a small profit out of it, enough to keep him in exist ence"" The Wheat Crop 1n t Hawke's Bay. — Our latest FlawWs Bay exchange paper says :— The wheat crop, we are sorry to learn, is completely destroyed in many districts by rust, supposed to have been in duced by the unusually wet summer ex perienced in this province. The Weather and Crops in Nelson. — The. following is from the Examiner: — At no former season do we remember vege tation so luxuriant as at presenr. The weather has been showery during the past month without heavy rain, and there has been almost a to f al absence of westerly wind which usually prevails at this season nnd dries up the jrround immediately the soil is refreshed with showrs. Rain fell on the. 6th. ?th. and Bfh of the month, on the 14 h. 15th, 16th, 17th. and 20'h j and on the 27th, and 28-h — in all on ten days, giving a fall of 2-62 inches, which shovs how light the rain has been. A period of wet days from the 14th, to the 20th excepting only the 18th, wns of most un usual duration, and coming as it did when a good deal of grass was cut, it- will be found we fear to have seriously damaged it. Grass is everywhere abundant, and the sheep runs never looked so well as they do at the present moment. The grain crops promise to be unusually heavy, par ticularly harlev, of which a good dwal ap ppars to have been sown. Oats, in some places, are ready for cutting, and, with anything like weather, harvest will gener ally commence about the middle of the present, mouth. The Harvest at Timaru. — The. ' Herald ' says: — We learn that a few small patches of oats were cut the latter end of lasc week in the Temuka and Geral dine d^tricts. The crops- generally are very heavy, and a good quantity will con sequently have to be cut by the scythe. Labor is reported to be very scarce, and men are asking high wages.

371,1892-05-31,HBH,Hawke's Bay Herald,9,"Hawke's Bay Herald.  TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1892. SPECIAL JURIES.","There aro two ways of levelling. There is levelling up and there is levelling down. The present Ministry seem in love with the latter process. The latest instance Is tho proposal to do away with grand and special juries. Sofarasgraodjurlesarecon corned, there is not very much to be said against) their abolition. They are useful to a certain extent, in saving the time of Supremo Court Judges, Crown Proso cutors, and common juries, Too many magistrates simply refuse to exercise ordinary intelligent in committing for trial persons who aro chargod with indict able offences. In cases where they would unhesitatingly acquit if the final decision rested with them they just as unhesitat ingly commit individuals ior trial. Thsy trust to the grand jury to throw out the bill. Perhaps if thero wero no such intervening body magistrates would not be so lax in throwing off responsibility. In that event there would tie no strong reason for the retention of grand juries. Bat the case is altogether different with speoial juries. They are an absolute necessity if justice is to be done between man and man. There are no special jutieß in criminal trials, and it is argued, with somo amounti of surface plausibility, that if a common jury Ib competent to try a man for hia life, it is an equally com petent body to settle disputes as to bis property. But in criminal trials the jury has to find a verdict on facts only. Any qnestion of law is leaetved for the judge. In civil actions), however, there are large and Intricate questions as to commercial usage and practice submitted to juries: Special knowledge and education above tbe average are necessary to enable any body of men to grasp the intricate pro blema often submitted to special juries. I There is no class distinction in the matter. The Crcwn provides common juries for all litigants, lf one party to an action be lieves that a jury selected ab haphazard from the common jury list would nob be likely to comprehend the niceties of com- mercial usages involved in the suit, he oan apply for a special jury, but he has to pay the jurors. Some fifty names are drawn from the special jury list, and each party can alternately strike off names until only twenty-four are left. The HpglstrsVs ballot-box decides which twelve out of the twenty four shall try the case. A spocial jury is open to everybody. True, it has to be paid for, but to aoydne rioh enough bo idulgo in a Supreme Court action ftfe extra payment is immaterial. Tbe addi tion to the bill of costs is, in most cases, but a fractional percentage. In return for thia li'igaots get the advantage of the business knowledge of a specially-selected jury, who are far more competont to pro nounce judgment on maoy matters than a Supreme Conrt judge, Oot to mention a common jury, Ministers appear to think bbc levelling-dowu process is a popular one, and their one god ia popu larity. But they would soon find their error if they abolished special juries. It would be unpopular with litigants, and it wonld be anpopnlar with jurymen. At I present there is no little grumbling on tbe I part of working men taken from their employment lo serve as jurors. It is tbe experience of many to wait about the Supreme Conrt for days without being Called. Tbey are prevented going to work, arid gab nothing for hanging about. If they are c tiled as jarora they get about half the pay of a laborer. Not a session of Parliament passes without an attempt to increase the payment) to common jurors. Everyone agrees that tbe present system in&icts hardship on many men who are dependent on their dally work for tbeir dai'y pay. Only tbe cost to tbe colony of tbe increased payment prevents Parlia ment agreeing to it. To abolish special juries wonld bo to add an additional burden to common jurymen. Those wbo now have to leave their businesses to spend days together as special jurymen would no doubt he glad of the change. It wonld relieve tbem. Bnt it wonld inflict hardship on others less able to afford tbe time, while in many cases, for want of knowledge, common juries would oot do justice to the issues placed before them. From no point of view can we imagine a good case to be made out for the abolition of special juries,",0,-1.36426348,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/hawkes-bay-herald/1892/05/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

39,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,16,PORT MOLYNEUX.,"(FVom Our Own Correspondent.) January l3rh, 18?0. A meeting of the. settlers in this district Was held in tne schoolhouse, on the 6th tnst. The chairman said the object of ?he tape tin? Was to 'consider how far it whs advisable for the Government, to seM a por* tion of the reserve land adjoining iPort Molyneux, .and called Upon Mr Thomson j who, during the time of the last fitting of the Council, had some communication with the Government <>n the su'ject. Mr Thomson , M P.C., said his attention iiad been drawn to the matter of the re* serve lands in conjunction wi'h Port Molv cenx, through nn advertisement in the * Advertising Sheet,* stating that a portion t)f the reserved land was ro be surveyed into sections of 4, 5, and 10 acres, and to be offered for sale. He considered that it ■would be injurious to the interests of the $?ort if any of the reserves were sold, and he had waited upon the Executive to ascer ' tain the intention of fh« Government. The Executive met him and (I understood) Iris col league, Mr Henderson, and stated that they intended to sell not less than $00 acres. Mr Duncan, a member of the the Executive, appeared to t?ike a good tleal of interest in the matter, and he ad mitted that the Government hud bad a large amount of money from the town sections sold ar Port Molyneux, and nl lowed that owners of property at the Port had a fair claim on the Government. The other members of the Executive did not consider tne Port was entitled to any p'i vilejje?. After the interview, he consi dered it his duty to bring 1 the case l>efore the Council, and placed a motion on the notice paper accordingly. When the Executive invited dims* If and colleague m another interview, the Government were tnuch more moderate, and proposed ro survey and offer 250 acres. He did not consider that reasonable, and they ulri mutely agreed to put off the survey until the members had an oppor unity of con sulting their constituents in rh* district. The subject was before them and be hoped they would be able to come to something definite to lay before the Government. Mr D. Henderson, M.P.C., said that Mr Thomson had explained the position of affairs so clearly, that it was unnecessary for him to add much more. He considered that the land at present reserved should not be alienated in any way from Purr Molyneux ; if they had an eye to their own interests, they would not allow a tingle acre to be sold. We stood in a different position with the Government than many other townships ; for instance, at Balchitha, very little monet for sections in that township had reached the coffers of xbe Government. The Kind where the principal part of the township was erected, belonged to a private person, who had wisely laid the land off in quarter-acre sections and sold them at a hig-h figure, while the government sections would not realise the upset- price. Some of the sec tions at Porr Molyoetix bad. been sold as high as L 132 10s, and many sold at v«rv high prices. The proceeds from sections bad been much more at the Port than at most of the -other townships, so much so that the exrra amount realised would pay for three times the number of acres re served, and the Government ought to he satisfied without attempting to wrest from the settlers any portion of the land reserve. There was not any land in this district be longing to the Government for sale, ex cepting 1 town sections, and if the reserves were aoldj the Government or the Port would have to pay sweetly at a future time for land for public purposes. The natural features of the river at the Port and Moly neux Bay, indicated that a great future was in. s tore for this Port. Much was re quired to be done, and instead of allowing any portion of the reserves to be sold, they should try and secure them in such a man ner that they could be leased, aud the proceeds accruing therefrom be expended in improvements at this Port. Mr George Hay recommended that 300 acres should be surveyed and offered for sale in lots of not more than five acres at an upset price of L 2 per acre. Such h system would prohibit any one person from buying the whole of the land, and give an opportunity to working men to secure a few acres If sixty allotments of five acres each were put up for sale, we might reckon on at least thirty settlers ; this would give a stimulous to this Port. Mr E. M'Glashan said he was a land owner in the district, and took an interest in it. Previous speakers were wrong in saying- that the. soo and odd acre* were a reserve for the benefit of Porr Molyneux township. The most part of the land in question was se* apart for the convenience of persons landing sheep at the Port. He thought the meeting was asking too much, and that 200 acres would lie ample as a re serve for the benefit of the township. Mr Thomson begged to correct Mr M'Glashan ; the land now used as a re serve. Was intended for the benefit, of the township. A portion of the land now oc cupied by Mr Henderson (a bout 200 acres) was the land Mr M'Glashan referred to, which had been set apart by the hon. Major Richardson when that gentleman/was Su perintendent, but had since been sold by x the Government. Mr Glass quite-concurred in the remarks of one of the former speakers, that the Whole of the land as now reserved should .be kept for the benefit of the Port. He knew that many of the working men had been induced to stay at the Pore in conse quence of being allowed to run one or two cows on the reserve, and on the adjoining tin fenced ground! The business part of Port Molynenx and many of the town sec tions were actually in a swamp, and, us we had seen of late, subject to be covered with water; there was every probability that a town would be built on a portion of thejpround it wag intended should be sold. Mr James Pa tenon condemned the plan of telling the reserves, and ridiculed the idea thnt a working man could maintain himself on ten acres of land situated where the reserve was. Mr Tfiic sai(| he considered Mr Hay's suggestion of selling"" the reserve, a very had one, and if it was acted upon, very little land would be sold, and less settled upon. Th^re was very little labor to be h;id at or near the Port for a working- man or his famil , and it was ut'erly absurd to say fhat h family conld exist on the pro duce of five acies of land. He wo-ild move ""That this meeting having heard with rearer that the Government intend ro sell a portion of the land now used as a reserve in connection with this township, and seeing*, that from the natural features of the Pon, »nd the peculiar advantages ot Molvnenx B-.iy, that this port will in a short time be the second shipping? port in Otijoo; that a large number of 'he toivn sections have been sold at a high price, tosrether with all the. available land m the district: should the reserved land be sold, the Government or the inhabitants in this district will at a future time, require t> re-purchase land at. a hitrh price for public purposes. This meeting- therefore propose that a memorial be presented ro his Honor the ' Superintendent, praviujr that the land in question be secured for the benefit of Port Molvneux; that Messrs Thomson and Henderson be requested to present the memorial."" Messrs Hay and Tait had a long discus sion, each supporting his own theory, when the chairman intimated that such a pro ceeding* was irregular. M> Tilson seconded the motion, which was unanimously carried. Mr Hay begsjed to state that he had no o''jei;tion to the township having the benefit of the whole of the reserved land, but was afraid that in asking- £»r so much they might not vet any. J It whs proposed that a Committee be appointed to give effect to the resolution, and on Mr Paierson's name being men tioned, he indignantly refused to act. j the names then stood — Messrs Hay, Thomson, Henderson, Ancell, Tait, Burn and Jen kinson. Mr Paterson, (who by this time, ap peared to be on the best of terms with ! himself, and was sufficiently generous to I propose that others should do that which he had premptorily refused to take a share in) proposed as an amendment thut Messrs Jenkinson. Glass and Fait be a commit iee, which was carried, when a vote of rbanks to the chairman closed the proceedings. On Monday evening, the lOi.h instant, a meeting* was held in the Schoolhouse, for the purp»?e of apnointins: a School Committee. Mr J. H. Jenkinson was voted to the chair, and read from the * Ad vertising- Sheet' the notice calling the meeting. The Secretary said that having- had some difficulty with former teachers, the com mittee had evidently made up their minds not to interfere with the teacher, so far at anvrate as the discipline and internal con ducting- of the school was concerned. He had often had an inclination to drop into the school with an intention ol noticing how things were getting on, bur delicacy had always stood in the way. Financially, the commirtee were in debt when they took office, the particulars of which was the remnant of the Teacher's salary, advertis ing 1 and stationery, L? 7s 6d, and the ex penses during the year for coals, cleaning the school, dtc, LI 5s 6d. He was glad to say that from funds received trom a vocal entertainment under the patronage of the M.U.1.0.0 F. he had been enabled to pay off the amount, and there was one shilling of a balance to be bonded over to the gentlemen about to be elected. Mr Jnmes Shields proposed a vote of thanks to the Secretary and Treasurer, Mr Wylie, and in doiny so, passed a very high euiogium on him for past services in the cause of education in the district Mr George Balloon had much pleasure in seconding the motion. Whatever other faults Mr Wylie might have, he appeared to be very sensiblo of the value of educa tion, lift had heard him highly spoken of in connection with t'ue Port Molyneux School, and it must be a consolation to him to know that his services were «p-. predated not only by the committee, but by the parents in the district. Although there were not many present at the meet ing to rendet their acknowledgments, he was sure that the sentiments would be re sponded to by every settler in the district. The motion having been carried by ac clamation, the following persons were elected a School Committee for the ensu ing year— Messrs Shields, Wylie, Balloch, Ancell and Jenkinson. An examination of the scholars is to take place on the 20th inst. ; prizes are to be given, and it is to be hoped the parents of the children will attend. w Mrs Vivian remains in Paris, having, it is said, declined the Marquis ot Water ford's offer of marriage. Mrs Rye is still busily prosecuting 1 her Sfood work. She sailed from Liverpool last week for Canada, having: under her charge eight boys and 68 girls, who are accompanied by 18 adults. The children ar« chiefly from the Liverpool Industrial- School, the others being from the London workhouses.

MINUTES, JH The minutes of the previous were read and confirmed. chaikman's STATEMENT. The chairman stated that in accord, ance with the resolution passed by thi board at its last meeting he had visitej the spot where Mr Ford bad stated Mr Sugrue was willing to sell a piecj of land for the purpose of making J accommodation road. The piece of lan required and obtained at this spot im about 32 perches. Of this about bjfl the laud had been washed away, was now riverbed. Mr Sugrue £2O for the land, which he (the man) considered excessive, and- iM offered £7 10s for the piece required. This had been refused, Mr Sugrue finally declining to accept less than £l2. It now remained for the board to decide what they would give for the land. Mr Flatman thought if all the land was arable land the board should be prepared to give even a little mora than the owner had giyen for it. As. the land was partly riverbed the price offered was a good one, and the board should not be at the loss of the hvA washed away. ■ At the instance of Mr Kelland tjfl property tax valuation was looked uH and was found to be £lO per ac: including the owner's Louse. The board considered the offered, viz., £7 10s, was a very one. It was pointed out that the could be' taken under the Works Act."" «H The chairman also stated re the way crossing at Orari applied for by Mr Binskin and others that the land \ had been sold to Mr Howey, but he (the chairman) had ascertained from the Commissioner of Crown Lands i that the board had a reserve perma nently vested in them close by, and the commissioner had suggested mak ing an exchange of land with Mr Howey. This had been suggested to Mr Howey, and he had written to the board accepting the exchange provided the board erected a substantial fence between his land and theirs.

280,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,207,SOME CURIOUS AFRICAN CUSTOMS.,"An authority divides cannibalism into five different classes— cannibalism of necessity, cannibalism of desire, cannibalism of theo logy , cannibalism of discipline and education, and cannibalism of revenge. And although it is doubtless interesting to.tbe student to classify and seek oat causes, what a matter of supreme indifference it must be to tbe individual sacrificed whether he is being eaten because there is no other food handy or because he has excited the anger of bis enemies I The deplorable fact that be is being eaten is quite sufficient for him. Tbe natives of tbe Fiji Islands were notorious cannibals, although missionary work has almost entirely done away with the praotice. Human flesh was looked upon as a great delicacy by the Fijians ; it was considered even superior to pork, and a special fork was used to eat it with. It would appear that, besides being so tasty, human flesh is a very nutritive diet.^Bome of the races who lived upon it being remarkably fine. The mere fact of cannibalism is revolting enough, but wben we come to some of the details we see the cruellest of created beings in his true colours. Not content with eating his fellow men, he chooses and marks off favourite portions of the body of bis victim while he is still alive. During one of Mr Poortey's journeys in the Upper Congo, he came across two black Blavea tied together, with certain marks on their bodies. He found out that these men were to be killed on the following day, and that the marks were made by purchasers ■who had thus selected the parts they liked best. The witch doctors have great influence over the superstitious people, and this in fluence is nearly always exerted for harm. Every sort of horrible cruelty is practised in the interests of the profession. Lobengula's great witch doctor, Mwagbene, was a monster of cruelty, and was hated and dreaded by all the Matabele. He was caught at last by Colonel Goold-Adams, who, "" after a full inquiry, bad this brute shot, to the great delight, but also to the great wonder, of the assembled natives, who had until now considered Mwagbene to be an immortal."" He used to "" smell out"" any person whom he thought might as well be killed, and that unfortunate person was at once knocked on the bead by order of the king. The least eign from Mwagbene was sufficient to cause a man to be put to death. When natives arc seized with illness it is often supposed that evil spirits are afflicting them, and propitia tory sacrifices have to be made, human beings preferred. Little attention is given to the ordinary remedies ; a care is not attempted ; the disease must be grappled with and ejected by main force. Diseases are most often attributed to the malice of relatives and friends ; even when the latter are dead they are occasionally troublesome. There is a story of a certain chief who was afflicted with rheumatism in the legs, and who ingeniously dif covered the cause to lie in the offended dignity of his sister, who had died some time since, but who had unfortunately been buried without a coffin. He bad a coffin made at once and buried in a convenient place near the vindictive lady's grave. This, no doubt, effected a complete cure. Among these people human suffering and human life are thought very little of. Many are the stories of savage cruelty which missionaries and others bring to light. The following taken from Speke's journal illustrates the contempt in which human life is held : — "" King Mtesa loaded one of the carbines which I had given him with his own hand, and giving it full cock to a page, told him to go out and shoot a man in the outer court, whioh was no sooner accomplished than the little fellow returned to announce his success with a look of glee, suoh as of- a boy who had robbed a bird's nest or oanght a trout. The King said, • Did you do it well ? ' • Oh, yes,%oapi tally,' was the reply. No one asked or seemed to care to know what human being had been deprived of life."" Speke tells a sad story of a girl who had run away from her master because of his ill treatment, and who had found shelter with an old deorepit man. The king sentenced them both to death, but not to death only. They were to be "" dismembered bit by bit, as rations for vultures, every day until life was extinct."" This dreadful business was to be made to last as long as possible; the prisoners were to be fed up to preserve life. It is comforting to reflect that the poor creatures could not have carried out the last part of the programme, at any rate; they must have had little appetite the first day. King Mtesa lived in a perfect atmosphere of executions. Almost every day some woman of his palace or other unhappy in dividual was condemned to death. This state of things did not affect the king's spirits in the least — he was always to be found gay and cheerful. So lightly did he regard human life that when he oould not g-st game to shoot at he practised on human beings. It is customary in some parts to crucify a slave wben two parties had concluded a treaty of peace ; this is to seal the covenant. Sometimes the victims hang for five days before death takes place. No one heeds their cries of agony. In a land where such sounds are as common as the cries of wild beasts, they are not likely to attract much attention. Custom will make anything bear able, and the African is so inured to the sight and sound of human suffering that it is only when he himself falls a victim trufc he can estimate it at its true value — Pall Mall Gazette.",0,-1.441335375,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They went to a narrow lane, up which he would probably come, and rigged up a compli cated apparatus to trip him up and shower him with flour.

196,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,123,PASSING NOTES.,"Thei Oamaru clerics have been holding an anti-gambling Sunday, ail of them preaching simultaneously on the equal vioionsness of bazaar raffles, art unions, -and the totalisator. Said the Rsv. Mr Martin, as reported in the North Otago Timss : "" Raffling at a church bazaar was as much a sin as betting on a horse race or gambling on the stock exchange."" The Rev. Humphreys remarked that in business, circles gambling was some times labelled. "" legitimate, enterprise "" ; in religious- institutions; "" aft union*)"" "" bazaar raffles,"", ""surprise packets."" Major Birken sbaw, of trie Salvation Army, showed "" how aJriendly game, of cards in a social club' led to tbe gallows."" These utterances are of the kind that make- sober-minded reformers despair. If, as I said the other week, bazaar raffles are ""as much a sin-"" as racecourse betting, then racecourse- betting- is no. more a sin than' bgzaaT -raffles-. Young fellowa who have qualms about patting their £1 on. the- totalisator will hear this with relief. As. for art onions and' the stock exchange, I will relate^'my own experience. For years I subscribed to the London Art Union, and wa* punished by never getting a prize; Time* and of fc I have bought shares for a rise, and have been punished by, set>iDg those particular Bbares immediately fall. I am prepared to believe,. therefore, that trans actions'of this nature are attended by moral risks. But when. I am told by clerical experts- that, morally, I might just as well have dropped my/ money, at poker, fan tan; ot unlimited 100, lam staggered. Listening to moral guides- so disquieting, a. man feels that '""E dunno w'ere 'e . are."" All distinc tions are confounded ; big is the same as little; a peccadillo is a crime and a crime a .peccadillo. Major Birkenahaw shows "" how a friendly game of cards in a club>conducts to the gallows."" Why does, he not' also show how walking on the roof of a house conduots to murdering your friend and rnnuing^awsy with his ' wife I>—vid* the example of King David. If only our colonial pulpiteers would bat acquire a few grains- of common sense ! Dbab Civib, — I notice that your opinions don't always coincide with those of the Premier, and as he has been having his say about medical fees, perhaps you would sympa thise with the other side of the question con tained in the enclosed paragraph from the Medical Record. — Yours, -&f!., M. B. ""My dear fellow,"" said my doctor to me, ""you have no idea of what we have to put up with. If I cal^to see a. patient frequently, *I »m trying- to rmi np a bill ; ' if 1- don't ' it is shameful neglect.' IM manage to get, t a church and am c*Ued out, I hear afterward,. * Working the Bob Sawyer dodge on Sundays — eh, doctor?' If lam so busy that I cannot go, I am sure, to be asked, ' How is it that you doctors are all atheists?' If my wife oaiU on people, it is because she is trying to get patients for me ; but if she doesn't, it is because she is too stuck up ! If I cure a patient quickly I' get credit, you say ? Oh, dear no ! The patient was not half as bad as the doctor tried to make out ; why, he was well in a week ! But on the othfr hand; should the case develop eerious' complications, ' Ah ! the doctor never understood the malady — in fact, he was worse when he- had been taking the medicine a week than when we called him in.' Ifr I suggest a consultation,, it is ouly because I don't know what ia the matter. If I.pcohpooh the idea, at unnecessary, it is because I am ashamed of showing my, ignorance. lam expected to, so to speak, cast a horoscope on the baby'a life, and tell its mother what its ailments will be. If I can't do that I cannot possibly know very much. I am expected to for* see all the ' ills that' fl^sh is heir to six months before they come.' I once lost a patient whom I had treated for influenza because I did not foretell an attnek of rheumatism which came on three months later. In all cases if- they get worse the fault lies in the medicine; if they get well 'it is the good ness of Providence.' If I send in nay bill they say, • He is in a terrible hurry for hia money ' ; if I don't, 'it is. so unbusinesslike.' But we get well paid, do you cay»? My dear sir, if I received payment for one-half I do I should die from shock."" Mr Seddon, I believe, "" thought the time not distant- when doctors' fees shoald be fixed by law."" He did. not add that, the .prompt payment of those fees should also be fixed by law. That would hardly suit so .well the Jack Cade spirit now dominant. If this dominance continues, it is conceivable that a good many things will be fixed by law which are now left to fix themselves by what Adam Smith calls ""the higgling of the market "" — the price of company shares, for example, or are fixed by mere individual will and whim, such, for instance, as the time we get up in the morning and the time we go to bed at night. From the Shop. Hours Act it is not a long step to a Govern ment rereitlea and a Government curfew. When I lived in a garrison town the trumpet tougued reveillee for the military at 6 o'clock* on a dark winter's morning was to me as a civilian an agreeable intimation that I was entitled to two hoars more of bed. Thus will it not be when Mr Reeves gets at us with his Early Rising Bill, which may be fittingly passed in the- same session as Mr Seddon's Bill for Fixing Doctors' Fees. Then we shall have to turn out promptly and no mistake, or the inspector will have as ap before the beak for fine-and imprisonment. About company 'shares, what a happy day- will that be when Waihie are quoted by aot> of Parliament at the same statutory price- a» Jutland Flats I And why not ? If fees are- to be tbe same ■for all doctors, why should not the' price of* scrip be the same for all | mines?- Way shoald we pay one lawyer more than another, or one music - teaohar more than another, or one parson more than another 7 Mr Seddon's intelligence will 'not be slow to perceive tbe endless pos sibilities of tbe principle he has announced in-the matter oE'dootors' fees. If'-he would kindly fix by law the age for gettiDg married he. might secure tbe vote and interest of not a few eligible spinsters. The Registrar general reports that the marriage rate ex hibits a steady deolino. Perhaps tho non investing bachelor may be explained as Oppotionists explain the non-investing capitalist. Both are frightened by the course, of legislation. Jack Cade should* know how to deal with them, and deal with them he doubtless- will, if only we give him time. The New Zealand marriage rate is low, Bays the Registrar-genera], and its tendency is to be lower. Let as not infer too much from a tendency. I bethink me of a re mark of Coleridge to Lamb : "" The tendency of this pieoe of thistledown is towards China ; bat lam quite sure' it will never get' there."" A marriage rate that tends down ward tends logically to zero and the cessa tion of marriage altogether; in fact and practice it will never get there. Bat it may get uncomfortably near thereto. I, for one, am for stringent measures. B?gianiug. with the civil service, no man over 25 years of age -should draw State pay except on the pre sentation, each quarter day, of a marriage -certificate, valid, and enrrent. No teecher no provided with a wife should be tolerated pin the. State-. schools, beardleaa boys ex cepted. A celibate parson ought to be regarded as sinning against the first law of his own religion — namely, that he should increase and multiply, and help, to replenish the earth. The women of his congregation may justly combine to get him married or to tarn him out. As for calibate doctors, they are already a rarity ; when detected, no quarter should be shown them. Lawyers are a harder case ; they be long naturally to the "" Devil's Brigade,"" and .are of ten, obdurate bachelors, haunting clubs and standing about doorways at evening parties, not even taking the trouble to dance. To get at a lawyer with pains and penalties 1b no easy matter ; if ho won't marry, let all married women combine to ostracise him. No woman Hue to the interests of her sex wonld vote for an unmarried man as a candi date for Parliament, nor, indeed, as a candi date for any thingelse, unless it is her hand. In these ways, and in others of a similar charac ter that will suggest themselves, much may be done to arrest the downward tendency of' onr. marriage rate. Here is a field for the Women's Franchit-e League. Soup kitchens 'are all very well ; thrusting charity in the form of; half-tester be Isteads on professional' mendicants is all very well (for which see inspector's report to the Benevolent Com mittee) ; the discussion of certain social sub jects too nasty to be specified here — t.hat, | too, is all very well. But there are things more important than even these. 1 invite the Lssgaa's earnest at'tntion to tha- figures of the Registrar-general and the suggestions of this note: A correspondent sends me the follow ing :— In the "" good old days "" when cock-fighting was a reputable entertainment and every oount.y boa* ted its pugilistic champion, the hanging of some poor mortal who had coma under the lash of the law ffai one of the most popular of spectacles ; and it being a "" free show,"" as a matter of course drew an immense crowd, .for in that respect it need not be told bum in nature never varies. The droll story in "" Icigoldsby Legends"" of the treat provided by Lord Tom Noddy for his boon c-jmp-mions at a Newgate hanging, points the attitude of our forefathers tjw»rd the old-established British method of carrying, out capital puniih ment. There was nothing improving, not to cay high-toned, in the spectacle ; nor in the hoarse, per«p'ring, drunken, and rollicking nieb, whowre-tl«=d and f ought for place through the tedious hours of the long night. Heine, when writing hia : travel«, tells of one Peter, who, "" having made geographical re searches in strange pockets, was on this account elected member of a public tre\d-mill institute. He eventually died in London, in consequence of wearing a much too long cravat, one end of which happened to be firmly attached to something just as a royal official removed a plank from be neath his feet "" There is no evidence that the colonists who c-ttne to this province in the firs!; ships brought among their necessaries either scaffold or hangmin's rope, and to tha<; extent they were deserving of censure ; for I am reminded of an o!d-fcimo local hanging sfcory. While Jarvie lay in Dnned<u Gaol ui^der sen teure of death the shci-.ft"", npjn whom is fell to carry out the norence, found birn-Hf iv * dilemma. Tiiuber there w\s in plenty, bub no rope could be fouud in the settlement or along the coast that was suitable or strong enough to bear the sudden stra ; n. Thera remained barely 40 hours to the moment fixed for tho executiou, and ib seemed all Lombard street; fco a Chiua orange that the term of J«rvie>'s natuial life would b8 unexpectedly lengthened, when a Home s^ip sailed in through the Head*. Ere she anchored ehe was boarded by a body of lumpers; and a search among the cargo bsanghii to lighb— luckily or unluckily— several coils of rope which — again providentially or otherwise — successfully stood the test. A four-ou-ed bout carried it swiftly to Dunedin jetty, where the delight of the sheriff was so pronounced that the boat's officer was effusively begged to accept a front seat at the hanging to-morrow. The subject is a grim one, too grim for humour ; least of all at the present moment, when, at Invercargil], a miserable, trembling, human creature — a woman moreover — is awaiting death by hanging. It is right that she should hang, or else that no other mur derer, man or woman, ever should. I observe that the Executive have assigned to the sheriff the unpleasant duty of choosing tho day. This seems hard on the sheriff. An Executive is several; a sheriff is one ; these disagreeable responnibilitie* are best divided. If, when the sheriff has chosen the day, he will kindly keep his choice a secret from the general public until all is over, the general public will feel greatly obliged to him. Oivia. The Argus, commenting on the Vic torian Financial Statement, cays :— ""Both as regards exports and economy the colony is emphatically on the right track. The. Treasurer's Statement shows that we can live within our present income and save, and that oar resources are unimpaired and developing. The Budget .should do much to strengthen the returning spirit of hope and enterprise, for the people instinctively feej that if the Government, have well turned the corner so have the 1 community also. For many years Victoria, has been a stranger to co cheerful a State ment."" The Age says: — "" The ia""'lwaya remain as the one financial blot. But for the defi ciency on them the year would have ended with a surplus. ol over L 300.000. But if. the railway receipts are the lowest on record, so are the expenses } and any sort of recovery in the rate of earnings would give a magni ficent profit, provided the management main tained the present scale of expenditure. On-, the whole, the Budget is the best story told! by the .colony for tho past five years."" A correspondent of the New Zealand Herald reports that on July 26 a number of Natives stated that an immense meteor had paß6ed slowly over, Maketu and di^appeared 1 on the Ocean Beach with a loud report When those who ventured to the top of the sandhill bbtwocn Maketu and the ocean came in sijdit of the latter, it was a seething mass of foam for a long distance. Great koreros have been held' over the mytterious vi-»itant, and it seems to be concluded by the Natives &t Maketu that this is the third visit of some great ancestor of the Ngamahutus named- Tv Kai Te Uru, and is a aign of — something — but what they are nob very well agreed upon. The meteor came from east ,to weit, and was seen by a number of Natives,, who describe- it as b&ing as big as a whare, with a long shining tail. The ground shook for miles round when the explosion occurred. • From the full text of the treaty between China and Japan, which hits reached this, .country, ifc appears that th? indemnity oV ""200,000,000 K&iping taels"".ia guaranteed, to Japan very thoroughly. While the final settle .ineni; is not due for seven years, no less than 50,000,000 taels must be handed over within s'x months, and an equal .amount, making, up on- -'■ i!f of the indemnity, within 12 months.

Our cablegrams report the death of Mr Joseph Thompson, F.RG.S., the African ex plorer. He was born at Penpont in 1858, and at the age of 20 visited Contral Africa in com pany with the late Keith Johnston, and assumed the commaud of tbe expedition on the death of his chief. In 1884 he began hio famous journey to Masailand, and was guc ce>bful iv reaching the nortb-easteru corner of Lake Victoria Nyanza. He published a de scription of his journey under the title of ""Through Misailand."" In 1888 he started on an expedition to Morocco, during which he crossed the Atlas chain of mountains in six d=ff t-rent places. In 1889 he published "" Travels in the Atlas and South Morocco."" He had received the gold medal of the Royal Geo graphical Society, and was alfo gold medallist in geology and zoology in the University of Edinburgh. There was an unusually large congregation in Firwfc Church on Sunday evening, when thaEtv. Mr Tait presched for the last time during his present vuit to the city. His subject was "" The Ideal Church."" He was listened to with marked attention. Referring fco the suggested union of the churches, he said' h<j w-*b not greatly enamoured^ with the idea. He could not imagine hinigelf an Anglican, or a Baptist, ®r a Wesley an, buthe waa prepared to assist all or- any of these in establishing and extending the Kingdom of Christ. In concluding bis discourse, the rev gentleman said he felt con strained to ssy, a F ter the fashion of Paul at Athens, ""Ye people of Dunedin, I perceive that in all things ye are far too hospitable "" For their extreme kindness to Mrs Tait and himself he desired to offer hearfciesb thanks, and to B^y that their stay in Dunedin would always remain as one of the brightest memories of their life. In wishing them all "" Good-bye,"" be hoped that the large congregations which had favoured his ministrations in First Church would not be without some fruitful and per manent result. The women's franchise soup kitchen which was staited in Stafford street atr the beginning of the present winter still continues to provide a wholesome and nourishing meal daily for a large number of hungry mortal/!, many of whom would in all probability have fared badly but for the benevolence of the members of the Franchise League. These ladies, with the assistance they have received from the general publio in the way of donations of food and money, have been enabled, it is estimated, to euoply o<\ the average about 50 families with billies of soup per diem, besides providing dif,n""rs at the kitchen daily for a varying num ber of from 30 I o 90 persons. The sewing bee, wiich ib run in connect i< v with V c s>>op kit hen, has dleo beea tbe means of supplying .over 1000 articles of clothing and about 80 blankets, &o. to persons iv needy circum stances.

At a meeting of tho members of the Dunedin Stock Exchange held on Monday a resolution wm passed strongly protesting against the pro visions of the new clauses prop sed to- be introduced in the Mining Companies Act Amendment Bill as an unwarrantable infcn ference with the liberty of the subject and as being a groF6 infringement of tho rights of members as citizens. The Otago High School Old Boys held their annual dinner at the Grand Hotel on Saturday night. The affair was a very great success, feeing the largest gathering of the kind yet held. A most enjoyable evening was spent, a good programme of musical and other items beiug provided. The bands have now been put in possession of •• Halevy,"" the test selection supplied by Messrs Wright and Bound for the Timaru band coutest. From a perusal of the score we (Oamaru Mail) are of opinion that the selec tion will prove a very good all-round test, *nd that it will certainly try tha stamina of the band*. Full parts are given to all instruments, and solos are set for soprano and B flat cornets, baritone, trombone, and euphonium. None of these are apparently d fficult, and will test the taste rather than the executive skill of the playera. Two special features of the piece are a duo cadenza for baritone and euphonium and a massive finale. The Oam aru Mail reports the death, on Satur day, of J.

He arrived in the colony in 1856, and the following year, in company with Mr Lockhart, took a herd of cattle from South Canterbury to Mataura, with the- intention of taking up a can in the latter district and settling' there. This he did' in 1857, taking up the Centre Hill run, between the Oreti and Mararoa rivets, beyond Mo*sburn Ha remivitied there for some years, but in 1863 sold out and purchased thr) Haka taramea Downs ran from Sir Richard le Fleming.

The Sawyers' Bay Hall presented a gay appearance on Fiiday last, when the employees of Messrs Michaelis, Hallenstein, and F*rquhar met for a social evening. The looalhead of the firm, Mr LVrquhar, in the course of a short address, referred to the harmony whiuh h*.d always existed between the firm and their work men, stating as an example that several of the men who had started wrhthem when the works were opened, 12 years ago, were with them now, while others had grown from boyhood to man hood in the employment. He hoped this good' feeling would still continue, and that the pre sent would only be the fir>fc of a long'aeries of such gatherings. After ju-iTTce had been done' to the excellent catering of Mr Cameron, the tables were cleared away, aud soDg.s, recita tions, and -dancing were freely- indulged in, a very pleasant enterrainmeufc being brought to ( a close by singing "" Auld lang syne."" . c The case Murdoch v. the .Farmers' Ageaoy Company has been fixed for hearing at th» civil sittings of tho Supreme Court on ""Thui-s day, August 22.

"" This was < satisfactorily answered, but it was said that the evangelist required a guarantee^of £25 a lecture, aud this statement rather damped the enthusiasm which was being mani fested in the matter by. some members of the presbytery. A. resolution was eveutually passed which did not greatly commit the presbytery. It is evident the Minister for Education intends to have somethiug. to say concerning regulations made by education, boards.

After the experience of tho snow— in which, however, Southland has not fared so badly as the northernera— it was pleasurable to have spring ushered in on Thursday by glorious sunshine, which, however, has been replaced by boisterous weather accompanied by minor rala showers. Although the losb of sheep will be of gre*t mo. merit in the outlying districts, yet up to the pre sent it is impossibles to gauge its extent. Tha trouble will come after the snow disappear!. The sheep, being weak, will scour on the youug grass, and from this cause great loss is sure to ensue. A good deal of comment has arisen over the threatened lawsuit by the Hon. J. G. Ward against Mr John M'Queen, a leading light in the Southland Frozen Meat Company, in respect to a circular signed by the latter gentleman, which, Mr Ward states, refltcta upon him. The prevail ing opinion is that the Colonial Treasurer has been too impetuous is fitting the cap to his own hea<i.

A petition is being taken round the district in favour of haviDg a, bridge placed over the W«iau river at the mouth, instead of at Clifdeu, where the bridge wss supposed to b« put. Of course it is receiving plenty of signatures, but 1 am very much afraid that it in all labour iv vain. In connection with this bridge, the settlers are receiving little consideration at the hands of the Government. Tenders were invited some tiraa ago, and none accepted, the reason given being; that they were too high, while as a matter of fact the actual cause was that no money was voted for the work, and so far as I can ascertain no appro priation is now made in the present Estimates. Perhaps the member for Wallace might attend to this. John William lunes, who was charged at the Poline Court on Monday with embezzling the moneys of the Pine Coropsny, pleaded guilty, aud was committed for trial at the next sittings of the Supreme Court.

The shock was qjere keenly felt from the fact that tbe lutle one had only been ailing for three dayß. an. attack of ncute inflammation of the bowels carrying her off very rapidly. Tbe funeral took place on Wed nesday afternoon, aud was followed 'by a very large gathering. The induction services in connection with the settlement of the Rev. A.

Twenty shareholders attended the meeting of the G<»re Dairy Factory. After leugthy discussion, it was resolved that a bond be prepared, confin ing the names of 24 or more guarantors of £50 each, to be got signed by the secretary, and laid before another meeting that day fortnight.

Both dogs are from the kennel of Mr Warrener, Oakleigh, Victoria. At Friday's meeting of the southland Education Board the proposal for establishing senior *cholar ships was again considered, the chairman (Mr Bain) exercising his right of reply, which he was denied at the last meeting of the board through tbe meeting lapsing for want of a quorum, some of the member* walking out to bring about this ■tate of affa rs. After a lengthy discussion Mr M'Lsod's amendment was carried on the casting vote of the chairman, who said it was advisable to allow the subject further consideration/ The amendment wa3 in effect that the report of the conference lie on the table for the information of the board when the scholarship regulations are being remodelled. Mr James Gardner, of Birchwood, who returned to-day via the north from the Sydney slud »heep sales, tells me that he knows one man alone, a Mr Elliott, who bought 1400 New Zealand stud rams at an average price of 6s 9d per head for boiling down purposes. He considers h« was lucky with his consignment of 45 Romney Marsh, which he sold on one of the last days of the sale at prices varying between l}g to ljg. It was Mr Gard ners intention at first to have taken over 3 I .rams, but hearing from friends that the damand would be limited, he wisely reduced his i-hipment to 45, for which he now feeh duly thankful. Jnvercargill, August 5. At the annual convention of the Southland branch of the New Zealand ATaaco today, .resolutions were passed thtt the convention protests sgainst the inequitable and unjust pro viVons of the Government Licensing Bill, on the grounds that it places the secernent of the question of prohibition in the hands of a minority of two-fifths of the elccto s plus one ; that it unnecessarily complicates the ballot paper, retains tbe provision for lha reduction of the act of 1893,"" while destroying the provi sions for adding the no license votes to the redaction votes, and practisally destroys all chauce of carrying ko license at any poll by complicating the isaue, and is in other respects opposed to the interests of reform ; also, that •the convention calls upon M.H R.'s-to vote for the bill framed by the A'liauce, aud. to support .also its. principles ; also to endeavour to have the principles of that bill included in the 'Government Bill in the event of the Alliance bill 'being superseded. August 6.

At a largely atttnded rmeeting this evening, the mayor ■ presiding, the resolutions protesting against the of the Government Licensing Bill ""passed at the convention yesterday were ..endowed unanimously. A fire broke -out between 10 and 11 o'clock ■last night in the Invercargill .South. School, a ilarge, commodious building, having accommoda tion for between 700 and 800 pupils. The fire brigades (two) were able to keep the fire con fined to the western wing of the building, wbicb, with its contents, was totally destroyed. The origin of the firo is attributed to the srhcol cleaner earelefsly leaving burning pieces of •wood standiDg near tbe -fireplace. The board's •architect estimates the damage at a little under £500. There was no insurance, the Government taking their own risk on this class of property throughout this district. The school will of necessity be closed on Monday next.

300,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,227,Just Choke Full of Fun.,"THE MORAL A NEW YORKEK DRAWS FilOM HIS BLACK BEAR STORY. "" I don't care what anybody says or thinks,"" s&id Max Ransom, of this city, au observant sportsman and one who thinks twice before he shoots; ""but I am convinced that the pre dominating trait in the character of the great American bear is a longing for fun. I mean the black bear. The grizzly bear and all his near relatives, or, as sotne say, his descendants, such as the silver-tip and the cinnamon bear, have no senso of humour in them. Tb*y a( at t out in the morning intent on fight, and if they don't find one they go back home uglier than when they went out. Nothing makea a grizzly or a tilve""r tip or a cimiamoa 60 all-Bred mad as to look for sometLi- g tj make him mad aud not find it. "" But the black bear, judging a3 I do from a personal experience, is simply looking for something to have fun with when he g >c? out. I bad killed quite a number of bear* before I had this little personal experience, but I have never killed one since, or attempted to kill one. I wouldn't have the blood of a bear on my hands for anythiog. Seems to me I'd feel as if I were amm dei er. I mean a black bear, of course. A mm who wouldn't kill a grizzly when he could ought to feel like a murderer, too, for the chances are that the grizzly thus spared will kill some man within the next 24 hours. Then, ot course, the raan who spared the bear would be acces ory before the fact, plain enough. ""The way I happened to change my mind about black bears aud their disposition was this: Two or three of us were up in Pennsylvania one full desr-hunting. One day, after standing on a. runway for two or three hours, and judging that the dogs had taken the deer in another .direction, I put my gun down and walked away a shoifc distance to a barberry bush (o pick some of the tart berries. A frost bad knocked the berries a.ll off the busb, and they lay thick on the ground beneath it. I stooped down and was enjoying tbe refreshing mountain fruit"", when I felt something tap me oa the shoulder. I looked up, and th'r^, towering abave me, and with a grin on its face as near as a grin could possibly be on a face not human, stood a bear at least sfb ta'l, beifcg on his bind feet, looking down at me, his forepaws hangirg limp against his chest. It was tbn bear, of course, thai had tapped me on the shoulder. ""Now, here was a situation. I couldn'6 get a 1 ; my gun. I had a koife in my pocket, but with that universal belief I had always had that the bear is a fit-rce, ugly, and pugnacious beast that wanders about with his eye constantly Skii*ned for someone that he can pitch into and scatter atout and chew up, I didn't think it vstquM be wise for me to rise from tbe base of that towering bear, right into his clutch, ycu might say, and defy him with a knife. 'Jhe bear seemed to be waiting for me to do something. I was in a squatting posture, arid really couldn't make up my mind what to do. So I remained just as I was, try ing to think what ought to be done under the circumstances. I guess tbe beir mint have got impatient, for he reached down and tapped me on the shoulder again. It was just a gentle tap, a? if he were simply calling my attention to something or other. Then I made up my mind. I thought I nrght throw mjself quickly forward, get to my feet, cut and run, and make a circuit among the trees, supposing all the lime that the bear would be chasiDg me, until I could get back to where my gun w&s. Once there, I would have no further appri hension as to the result. •'So I made a surge forward, but before my head had Ecarcely changed its position the bear's paw closed on my shoulder. In an instant he jerked me to my feet, turned me square round, and there I stood, face to face with him, he with a paw on each of my shoulders. 1 thought my only chance now was to get my knife in action before the bear finished me, and 1 care fully slipped my hand in my pocket and got the knife. I was stealthily passing my other hand over, to open the knife, when the bear calmly reached down with one paw, snatched it out of my hand, and threw it away. From the position the bear was in I might have given him a tre mendous kick in the stomach and doubled him up so that I could have gob to my gun before he got over the effects of the kick, but I didn't think of it, and lam glad now that I didn't. I wouldn't have known then what there really is in bears, and would have gone on killing them in cold blood. ""After the bear threw my knife away he took off my hat, looked it over, and then put it on his own head in a rakish way. He was more than grinning now ; he waa actually laughing, and his eyes twinkled mischievously. The next move he made was to unbutton my hunting ccafc and take ib off me as slick as could be. This he threw to one side, and then took off siy vesfc. He laid the vest on the coat. "" ' Heavens ! ' I said to mjself. • This bear is going to strip me so he can chew me up better.' •'After taking off my vesfc, the bear poshed me down on the two garments, and deliberately and expertly drew off my boots. Then he s%fc down opposite me and drew the boots on his own fee!;. After he had done that he yanked me off the coat; and vest, and tried to put the vest on himself. It was too small, but he got the coat ou all right, and then he was a sight that made me tumble right down there and howl. It was the funniest thiDg I erar saw. ■My mirth seemed to please the bear, and he danced around like a tipsy raftsman, cutting all sorts of fandangoes aud pigeon wing*. I guess this lasted 10 minute 3, and I waa sore all through from laughing, when suddenly the bear stopped, cocked his head on one side, and listened a mo ment. Then he stripped my coat off and tossed it to me, and, sitting down, pulled off the boots and gwe them back. To take off the hat and hand it over was only the work of a second, and then the bear hurried away into the brush and disappeared. He h&d hardly got away when along came my companions with their guns, lh-3 bear had heard them, and he knew what would happen to him from men with guDs, so he got away as qnickly as he could. ""Of c U'ae, my friends were surprised to see me sitting there half-stripped, aud when I told them what had occurred they acted as if they didn't believe mo. And they've acted that way ever tinea."" — New York Son.",0,-1.458593634,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Piior to last Monday we had some flue warm days, but on that day it commence t to snow about 5 p.m., and' kept «t it at interval* tip to Tuesday evening, when it began to freeze, and it has been freezing every night since. The snow, however, did not lie long, as it was all thawed by noon on Wednesday, except where drifted, where it is still lying. The average depth in the valley was about lin. Tuesday was a feaiful day ; some times blowing like a blizzard. Tbe oldest resi dents sjy they havo not known of a winter so severe and the snow to He so long. The cold is intense, and is very trying to anyone of delicate health. Farm Wonic- Ploughing is much retarded by frost, and consequentlythere is a good breadth to turn over yefc. Sowing ha 1 ? been started, but is also kept back by the frost, which render* the ground unfit for harrowing till about noon. Straw and turnips are ascaive commodity in the valley this winter, and I notice a number of straw stacks are beiug used up that have lain untouched foi 1 yeard. Thera is not much, if any, sign 3of spring in the fields as yet. Lime. — I am glad to say that the A. and P. Ass""ciatiou are at length wakening up to a fense of their responsibility in the matter of procuring lime for the district, for at their last meeting the following mo ion, proposed by Mr Souter, and seconded by Mr John, Douglas, was carried — ""That the Government be requested to stsnd a turveyqr or engineer to inspect the laud, and ascertain the most advantageous and practicable site for the dktiict as a whole, and with a recom mendation that steps bs taken at once to secure the land.""

283,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,210,PATER'S CHATS WITH THE BOYS.,"A Chapter or Two on India. XIV. And now I have come to my last chapter, and little did I think I would write so many when I started. Iv lo'OO a band of merchants originated the E is(, Indian Company, which was to lead to thti founding of our Indian Empire. It had its fig'iting fleets as well as merchant men. It maintained standing armies, an nexed territories, and could refuse permis sion, and did, to any European, missionary, civilan, or trader to enter India. Carey, the pioneer missionary, took passage in an English ship, the Oxford, but the captain felt so uneasy at the idea of landing a missionary that be put him ashore, and Carey with tearful eyes watched the disappearing vessel that so dis appointed him. He could only iand in India by embarking on a Danish vessel, which landed him at the D ujish settlement at Serampore, near Calcutta. Carey's party, eight all told, got the protection from the Danish Company that the British Company denied it. In 1785 the British Govern ment stepped in and inMbUd on appointing a G >vernor-general, who was to be supreme when emergency required. In 1813 its mono poly of ludian trades was abolished, but it retained its trades with the China Seas until 1833, when that was thrown open also. In the Bame year the company's work was restricted to political action, administering the law, and controlling the financial affairs of the country. In 1853 i»s navy was abolished, and a royal squadron was told off to patrol Indian waters. In 1858 the company ceased to exist even for the three purposes above mentioned. A word or two about the officials of India. They are divided into two classes — the* covenanted and the uncovenanted/ The former are appointed through competitive examinations, and consider themselves superior to the latter, who perhaps have worked their way up in India by a | practical acquaintance with Indian life and government, but bave either failed, are debarred, or have not attempted to pass the examinations set for the Indian service. Often enough young sprigs from England- are sent out and placed over the heads of those greyheaded in the service, the sole reason being that they qualified in England for the position by passing the necessary theoretical examinations. PBOSPEOTS OF ANOTHER MUTINY. Bub I promised last week to continue this point. I drew attention to the position the English language occupies on the list of spoken languages; to the small number of European soldiers— at the same ratio 150 would keep New Zealand in subjection ; and to the difficulty of suppressing perjury and corruption and of getting to the bottom of"" the Oriental mind. But there are other factors. .It in said that the gulf between natives and English is deepening and widening. In olden days Englishmen in India got far more in touch with its inhabitants ; now, owing to the faci lities for travelling, hardly any one stops long in India. ' The glacier-like advance of the forces of the White Ozar has brought Bussia within striking distance of the gates of India. An Indian < ffioial said lately that the fare o* the Indian Empire, when an attack is made, will depend not on who ultimately wins, but on who wins the first engagement ; and it is generally conceded that that first engagement isn't far off. Then it is a pro blem how native troops officered by British will .face- European troops. Many have proved themselves daring, resolute, and fero cious; but, on the other hand, the regiments re cruited from Bsngal and Central and Southern India are "" ill-acted to play a losing hasard. and are peculiarly subject to sudden panic, begotten as much by superstition as by fear,"" Another mutiny will likely be the result of plots hatched by Russia and France, who seem destined to pit their strength against Britain at no distant date, and France will attack from the sea side. And we must not forget that more than a fourth of India is still independent as far as internal government. The Nizam of Hyderabad rules 100,000 square miles;' popu> lated by over 13 million, and has an army estimated as high as 300,000; the indepen dent Rajput States have a population of 10 million. In many of the independent States the rulers have far more effective control of their subjects than the Britub. have of their*, and have introduced social reforms the British daren't for a moment think of. Native India possesses a practically free press, and I hate heard Anglo-Indians com plain bitterly of the libertj given to the 100 or bo newspapers, published in. the vernacu lar. There is now a native congress every year, attended by representatives from aft part* of India. The congress alwayo ex presses its loyalty, bat at the same time de* mands (or the natives more representation in the government, and auks for a native parliament. Various laws that press heavily on the natives as a subjugated nation are discussed and their abolition urged. Edu cation is rapidly spreading. There are about 135,000 schools, in which seme three and a-hAlf million Bcholars are being tanght ; and 14,000 enter the universities annually, of whom 3000 take degrees. These are all elements to be taken into consideration when we think of tho future position of India. More could be written on the difficulties to be faced invgoverning and holding India, but enough has been given to show yon that to keep India is relatively as bard now as in the days of Clive and Hastings, and far more will be involved in any futaro outbreak than those Indian pioneers ever dreamt of, wide as their mental vleion extended. ANNRXATIONS. Just one word more on what to me ia a peculiarly interesting chapter in English .history. Oudh was annexed before the mutiny, but the assumption of power by the British Government which followed the tnuHny, and the abolition of the company, did not stop th« extension of territory. As I have told you, Kashmir has been taken over since then; the north-west territory has been added to time after time ; a top shaped piece has lately projected itself west, in between Afghanistan and Baluchistan, while the latter U practically British territory. In 1878 another war with Afghanistan, suspected of furthering the Russian advance, led to the ctrengthmiing of the frontier across the Indus ; Bhutan haa been attacked and bumbled ; Upper Burmab in 1884 waa added to Lower Burmah, and British rule extended north to the Chinese frontier. The English and French are each enlarging their possessions in Further India, and are destined to face each other on the banks of the Mekong or Menam. In 1890 Sikki ■) was taken, and the following year the Manipur disaster took place, the while on 1 posts were thrown out towards Gilglfc. In 1893 Gilgit and the surrounding country waa snapped up. Away in the Bl'c'< Mountains a sharp tussle, with the u?ual reeuir, took place. In 'he same year the tnutWrings at Ohitral wero making therm elves heard, and that district is now being taken over. These are only a few of the many punitive wars that have taken place since the mutiny. The extension cannot, however, continue much longer except at the expense of the independent princes within the penin sula, for Afghanistan on the west, Russia and China on the north, and France in the east bar the way. And I think that must be my last word. I have traced the growth of India from beyond the British occupation to the present day — imperfectly, I admit, but yet, I hope, in a sufficiently clear manner for the ordi nary reader to have a fair idea of India past and present.",0,-1.517623042,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fortnight afterwards he was brought out for the New maiket Stakes, and having still more easily placed that event to the credit of his owner, continued his winning career in the Derby, for ■which he was followed home by Rawi sbury and Raeburn. After th ; s success he fulfilled no intermediate engagements in order to h*ve an uninterrupted preparation for the St. Ltger, which, with odds of 95 to 40 batted on him, he had no difficulty in winning, Ravensbury once more following him home and La Nicbam filling third place.* - He came out again at the •Manchester September meeting, where he met with defeat for the first time in tbe valuable Lancashire Plate in attempting to give 101b to Rjieburn, who secured the verdict by a length, - with La Flecbe third and Lady Caroline the other competitor.

The first of a series of diabolical and mysterious murders took place on the 28th of November, 1888, in St. Catharine’s parish, a few miles distant from Spanish Town, i'he victim was a negress of the lowest and most vicious class, whose name had never been dis covered. She was found early ia the morning lying by the roadside, her throat cut from ear to ear, her cheeks, nose, and forehead slashed about in a manner that would indicate it to be the work of a skilful butcher. The body was mutilated exactly as had been done in the London cases. If anything, further had been needed to make the horror-stricken crowd atuibuto the crime to the Whitechapel murderer it was found on a card pinned to the unfortunate woman's body by the blade of a small penknife. The card bore this inscription Jack the Rirmi. Fourteen more, then 1 quit. ' On the morning of the 13th of December, in a field, lying by and par tially concealed under an old shed, was found a second body. In this case the woman was a notorious creature of the lowest class, a negrasa culled “Mag.”, Her wounds were of the same nature as those inflicted upon the other. The field in which the corpse was discovered was scarcely a mile distant from the scene of the first murder. The authorities made a hurried investigation, and buried the body as speedily ns possible, giving no one an opportunity to examine it. No mention of the crimes was made at the time, the officials endeavoring, by every moans in their power to hush the matter up, and have it talked about as little as possible. No trace saß evor found of the murderer and it pm forgotten save by a few of the wretched women among whom the un fortunates moved. The third body was t'ound on the Friday before New Year's Djv. i'his time the newspapers were compelled to notice the discovery. The tfcem! of this third murder was about mid way between U>e pLces where the former diaooveriefl bud boeu iuade ? and theeailorb iuai-tt that the crime was in evepy way •niaioi'oiiH to the other?.—Western Moruiug News (Plymouth), February 9th, 1889.

18,1889-04-09,TEML,Temuka Leader,19,A DISTRESSING CASE.,"On Wednesday morning the at tention of the Eangiora police was drawn to a woman named Mrs Isabella Mawha, relict of Mr Matthew Mawha, of Saltwater Creek, who was living on 35 acres of laud, thereupon which is a six-roomed house. She had been the only occupant of the place for about nine years, since her husband’s decease, and has invariably refused to have any communications with her neighbors. Constable Costin, who went out, found that the woman was existing in a condition of extreme wretchedness, filth and dirt. Mrs Cameron, who had heard of her state, had been in to put matters a little tidy, but Mrs Mawha had reduced her stock of furniture to only a stretcher and an unwholesome pallet, upon which she lay, almost reduced to helplessness, The wood lining of the house had been broken up for firing, as well as part of a staircase, fcffie had bread—of a kind-which was unfit to eat, and had apparently been living for some time upon flour, of which there was a small stock ;' this wetted and baked into cakes in the ashes had formed the chief of her diet. On the couch was a blanket, beneath which was a large supply of wax matches, whilst the woman’s dress consisted of a blanket sewn about her. To the officer she positively declined to give any account of herself, or admit that she was in need of atten tion or comforts, but observed her only visitors were the fairies and Mrs Cameron, and next day Constables Cartmill and Costin had her conveyed to Kaiapoi. Here Mrs Mawha was examined by Drs Murray and Parsons, who certified to her morose and un fortunate condition, and on the order of C, Hansen and J. H. Wilson, Esqs., J.P.’s, she was committed to be kindly taken care of at the Sunnyside Asylum in the hope of a recovery. —Press.",0,-1.552627931,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/temuka-leader/1889/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1889-04-09,TEML,Temuka Leader,18,THE KAKAHU DISTRICT.,"[From the Pre*?.] Wo are indebted to Mr A. J 5. Or. Rhodes, M.H.R for Ukdstone, for a copy of the re oorfc furr.i'hod to the Minister of Mines by ProfeaßorTJhlrioh, giving an aoaount of hi« vi.it to the Kakabu aad Woodbury districts in South Canterbury, wbioh he made last month. From the repoit we take iho follow ing particulars :-Bor:erjno3 was made to th<3 reports of Sir James fleotor and of Mr J&». Puke, Assistant O-.o'.ogist, who visited the district In 1885, Profesior Ufalrioh remarking that in all respects, especially the descriptions cf tha mineral outorops and conclusions drawn as to their value, sere so defiled and aooarfcte in Mr Parke' report that ho could supplement it by only a few obieivations oonoerning some unimportant now diicovenes of gold, ooal, etc., made since, The only pold workings exeouted since Mr Parks' visit wore a few holas sunk in a gully running from the south into the lower gorge of the Kakahu river. Prospeotj of fine scaly gold were found in eioh, and one man who opened out from bis hola is stated to have earned fair wagos, but prospecting had long sinoj been given up, the alluvial drift ia the gully evi dently not on the whole being payable. As the gully ran entirely within the area of the older sohist rocks, the gold contained in the wash mnab have been derived from these rooks, aleo probably from the disintegration of fine quartz interlaminafcioDg, wbioh were in places rather abucdaat. Io was tie efore no unreasonable to suppose that better payiig plaoes than the gully under notioe might ex. iat within the erea of their extent, and as the range north of the gorge showed many lifts and small gullies which wero quite unprospecte:!, he thought it would be advisable to tost these by the sink ing of holes and tin-diah trials, a work requiring but little expense and labor. Regarding the ferruginous quvrlz, con glomerates, and grits, which occur in some plaoes near the baso of the coal rjeks, notably, a abort distanoe above the upper marble quarry in the lower gorge of the Kikahu river, and of wbioh, acoordiDg to a report of Sir James Hector, a specimen aißajed in the Colonial Laboratory, produced at the rate of loz sdfffc of gold per too, they had not as yet received any trial, thoogu. this would be desirable in order to ssttlo the question whether tha goli was evenly dis tributed throughout the deposit in anything like t'ae quantity indicated by the above assay. In bis opinion that was not the case, olse more gold would h&ve been found by former proßpectora in the river drifo baloar tho onglomerate outorops. Even, how ever, in the case of good prospeo.s beinj obtained by trials of the conglomerate on an adequate scale, by crushing and ataal gamation, he doubted very much whother it would pay to work it beoause of tho great difficulties and expense connected with combating the water and the safe support of tho workings, tho roof being rather loose. Commencing with the seams of ooal in tha lower end of the gorge of the Kakahu river, the Professor stated that he was oonvinoed that the seams penetrated by the shaft srak by Mr Geo. Meredith would never pay to work, on account of too strong en influx of water, and the same applied to several new outcrops discovered in the close neighbor hood, in the bod and banks of the river. The seam opposite Cliff's old saw mill, previously worked, was of ralher poor quality, but might improve in depth. It cauld be opened with little expense both in strike and dip, and might provo very acceptable for local consumption when wood became scarce. The outcrop on Mr Hesketh'u farm could, in his opinian, not be profitably worked oa aocount of its vertical dip, and the ex penses aud difficulties certain ti atiao through great icflax of water. The ee?m gaid to be two feet thiok, near the suspension bridge over the Kakahu river, previously worked, could not be examined owing to the slips from the hill above, but, judging from pieoes lying about, it was of similar quality to that opposite Cliff's old sawmill. As it was out of tne reach of water, Ike the latter, it might also be worked in c?je of soaroity of other fuel were it not for its veiy bad roof, the oosfc of supporting which wou'.d be out of all proportion to the value of tho coal wised. Other outowps two or three miles further up the river, never much thought of, were not visited. The seam near the point wbere the Beautiful Valley road crosßeothe Kakahu river, which was well spoken of in Mr Parks' report, the Profejaor considered was the moßt promising in the Kakahu district. It was exposed in the bed of the west branoh of the river for nearly 300 ft in length, dipping at the lame angle aa the stream, and about eight ohaius further up the latter there was another small out crop, whioh most likely belonged to the same learn. The thickaesu of the seam appeared to be a good 3ft, and, though having suffered through water action, the cost was harder, and looked as good quality as the best found in the district. its favorable mole of deposition, it could easily bo followed aoross the flat on both sides of tho water course into the hills, snd its exploration then would be free of difficulties roga-edbg influx of water, whilst, judging from what was exposed on the banks of the stream, tho roof of the coal was also pretty firm. In order to render the coal available for household con sumption and suou entsrpiises aa lime- burning, etc., the main requirement was the construction o£ two or tbree miles oE good road for connection with the nearest main road j traversing the district. The outcrop of sup* j posed roofing slate on the banks of the Kakahu river, not far south of the upper marble quarry, proved ou examination to be valueless, as it did not split thin and smooth enough, and even i£ it did was not suffi ciently tough to stand holing by the slater’s hammer. The industries of lime-burning and working the clays were still suspended, but they would have a good prospect of revival, end of being profitably carried on, wore the coal seam last described being worked and available at a reasonable price. The larger pieces of the schist rooks, which resembled marble, might be commercially valuable for ornamental purposes. Near the suspension bridge there was a large exposure of flue, compacted quartz said, such as is used in the manufacture of glass, but it would be inadvisable to start the industry m the dis trict under present circumstances, and the sale of the sand could not bo conducted with profit at a distance. The only mineral of any value so far discovered in the Woodbury district was brown ooal. The outoropi occur in two different places, namely, the Waihi (Jorge and in a creek nearly two miles from Mr Tripp’s homosteai. Considering the first-mentioned, there were four scams ex poaed, right in the fc.d of the Waihi mar, running across it with a southerly dip, the exact angle of which could not be ascertained, as no work had been done on any of the seams. The respective thickness of the four Boama were abated by Mr Geo. Meredith to be B£t, 21b, 3ft, and s£fc, but these thicknesses, being measured . outcrops in the river, are considerably in excess of the true ones at right angles to the plane of dip. iaegardiug the quality of the thickest seam, judging by Bpecimose broken out from under water, it aoomed to be of a more tough and woody character, and Icdb rich in carbon thnn tho ooftla o£ tka Kflkahn diatrict. Still it might, if worked, prere quite satisfactory for domestic use and foi feeding the furnaces or threshing machine engines, lime burning, etc. Its opening and ' working, except that it would have do be done by shaft, would apparently not bo connected with any great difficulties, such as contending with much water, beoauie tho Booms extend on both sides of the river under pretty high banks of firm-looking more recent deposits. The coal outcrops near Mr Tr pp’s homestead were situated in tho bed of a small crook, the thioknesfl ol the seam being nearly 4ft, and its quality oeemod eqaa', if rot superior, to that of the largest seam in the Waihi gorge. Ho was doubtful if the ex ploitation of the coal would prove profitable, bacaueo of tho steep dip ot the seam, and tho probability of a strong influx of water.",0,-1.574279055,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/temuka-leader/1889/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sheep have carried well. Sydney, July 31. The meat market shows a distinctly harden ing tendenoy, and prices are advancing. Beat mutton shows a rise of from 2* to 313 1 on last month's quotations. In the counae of an interview with carcase butchers they stated that really good sheep and cattle are hard to procure. There is too much likeli hood of greater scarcity if the dfcught, which is becoming very severe in the gr&z'iDg dintriota, continues. Grazers rushed , their surplus stock into the market in fear of a drought, and there is new a shortage. The large growing export 'of live and fr^zsn sheep combined must, it is considered, lead to a considtrable rise bef .ire long. Graziers are also beginning to look for improved prices. At the half-yearly meeting of bhe Qrsziers' Meat Export Company, the report Rhowed that the works established at Nycgan )md proved highly satisfactory, but owing to the drought supplies of fat stock wore limited and had handicapped operations. Progress was being made in the establishment of works in other pastoral centres, and for this pur pose it was intended to call up a sum of L 35.000 of the capital. Tho report added that there w&s a promising future before the company, and that it had been decided to consider the question of the establishment of retail Bhops in London.",0,-1.58362862,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

78,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,5,NOTES ON RURAL TOPICS.,"We are constrained to ask, amid the severe snovrst^rins that have visited Return the southern portion of the of tho colony in particular, Is the Glacial Period, glacial period returning ? From far and near come the same re ports of heavy snow foliowed by a very low temperature and its acer mpinimentof frost; and fca. The sqow lies heavy over a great portion of the interior, and the froj-t ha 3 ssaled it up, bo that it will He till the sun gains strength eDough to conquer the frosts. Reports come from far and near of loss of cheep, and the actual loss will never be known till the snow disappears and the sheep are mustered. There is no doubb bnt that when mustering time comes round the lo c s will be found to be serious. The winter of 1895 will be remembered as one of tfce few — happily so — disastrous winters for stock in tbe South Island. The storm cloud has its silver lining, and the ia fiuence of tbe cold and snow is not altogether bad. For one thing, the wholesale de-tructirn of the rabbits will be a boon, as it will take them some time to recover lost ground again. As soon es tbe enow leaves the ground no time should be lost in laying poison for rabbits, for those left will be in a staivicg condition, and will take poisoned grain greedily. One reeult of tbe snow has been to ob'.i'erate the rabbit fence along thft Canhrlury boundary, and rabbits have had free access into forbidden grrund ; and now ss soon as spring fairly sets in all the rivers and streams ore certain to bi flooded, so that the bou: clary rabbit fence will stand a good chance of being broken in many places. Another good result of the cold weather will te the destruc tion of small birds and insect pests. The latter in particular will have had a wholesome check applied to their development. The frosts will becefit the ploughed ground greatly, and on the whole the geirs will more than balance the losses. Ifc is to te deplored, just when bright h&prs were beginning to lor-m abend, that such serious loss of stock should have befallen so many sheepownera, bat these are the risks that th se engaged in pastoral pursuits matt take. If we do ence in a while get a severe winter, we never have to endure disastrous droughts ; so we must not murmur tco much at our hard case ; our Australian co pasloralists have more than the winter's cold to fear, and unless good rains cfme coon a disastrous drought is threatening Victoria and New South Wales. Our cokny will speedily recover from the effects of the present winter, and when summer brings abundance of feed and good crops cf grain, the disastrous winter of 18S5 will soon be forgotten. How the Foreign Meat Trade is Vievred Ln England. An organisation known as the Central Chamber of Agriculture for England has had a reporb prepared on live stock in re'ation to agricultural depression. O.e part of tho report is of interest to us— viz., that ieferring to the colonial meat export trade. The report declares 1 , to begin with, that imported meat oughb not to be sold as English. With this recom mendation every colonial exporter of meat will heartily agree, scsing lhat the common practice is alleged to be to sell the best colonial meat as Eogl sb, while the woret and damaged carcases are openly sold a3 New Zealand or Australian mut'on. The committee further report that there should be no importation wh'*teier of live stock except for slaugt ter at (he poit of land iDg, whether the countries fr^m which they come be fiee of disease cr rot. This rf com mendation a; pears rather EilfUh on Ihe face of it, and I think tLe Agricultural Committee should have gone a 6typ further and have re commended the prohibition of all importation of Jive stock whatever. If slaughter at the pert of landing is imijted ou, that means greab inconvenience to the colonial shippers of live cattle and sheep ; and ia the event of a ship ment landing oat of condition, great less. It will cccanionMly happen ihit a live-cattle steamer will meet in with storms and other adverse circumstances, which will haro the tff'Ct of puling down the cattle in condition b fore knditig, when of courae irnmrdiate slaughter means loss. But if the cattlo, after insp- cbion, are fonud to be healthy they sh' uld be allowed to land for ihe purpose of feeding up into good conditiou a<<ain. The E 1 g'i*h farmers might run the tisk of losing by the e.ttersion of the livestock trad«>, but the people who con«umß the meat will profit hy the fuller competiru n and consequent reduction in prices. The fear of disease is a pretext ; the real fear is reductfoo in prices frcni the competition of the colonii-s itnd other countries. Nearly Ofery stock disease un.ier the sun is already in Britain, and it is only by ineana of constantly fighting some of the more prominent that they can be kept in check. A table before me at the present time shows that during the first 11 weeks of the present year no less than 43 cat'le were slaughtered for pleuro ; 7123 swine wer« slaughtered for swine fe?cr ; and 246 animals were attacked with anthrax. In the f*ce of those figures it is difficult to know why the British farmer ia so sensitive on the point of possible contagion from abroad while lie has the real danger lurking within his own border*, and in evidence every day. I should say that the danger from plenro in cattle sent from New Zealand and Australia ought to be reduced to a minimum. If any beast 3 are effected when put on board ship the hardships of the voyago will soon causß the disease to show up ; and should it do to the balance of the bessts on board would hardly be likely to lind in a healthy condition at the other end. If a ship ment of cattle appear in perfect hr-allh after a long ocean voyage, I should nay a'l danger of infectious disease is p&sb. In the debate wh ; ch followed the reading of the report ono of tbe speakers eaid thats tho price of meat would be still further cheapened owing to the disposition of foreign and colonial governments to encourage the exportation of food of all kinds by working the bounty system The same speaker said there was scmo danger of a lowering of pticea, "" for in the Australian colonies and New Zealand the cattle bred and fattened are as gool as we have in England, and the resources of tbat Greater Britain will for many yens to come be inexhiuslible."" Smut in Grain. A Frenchagcicultursl authority has bien giving an opinion on the occ*irr«nne of s-nub in grain. In his r piuion ifc is the result of a cryptojjaraou3 parasite or microscopical fungus which wreaks its havcc upon wbeafc, barley, oata, and maize. The ears that have been attacked by this formidable enemy are easily recog nised by the great alteration in tbe floral envelope and the ovaries. The floral envelope sometimes entirely disappear"", and the ovary i 3 chauged into a vtsicule which contains a mags of black, cduurless dust. This dust* is in reality the spores of the fungus, and their dissemination tecomso easy by the ordinary operations of farm work. The spores will be conveyed by straw and grain after threshing time, and so disseminated, and where the crop grew they will contaminate the soil, and even lie buried for a couple of years till a favourable season occurs for bheir development, when they will attack future crops. The com mon method of dealing with smut is to sleep the seed grain in bluestoue, or sulphate cf copper, but the cheiper sulphate of iron is equally effective in destroying the spores of the flinub fungus. At any rate blnestone is ofben mixed with sulphate of iron (coppera*), and both crytta'lUed together before the farmer gets his bluesfcone for steeping seed grain. A solution of commou salt or lime water of full strength will also destroy the sports. Where the foil appears to be full of the fungus, and no e'ean crops can be grown, the best plaa is to lay that field down in pasture for a faw years, or grow some other crop not subject to the black enemy. f?mufc in wheat is a terrible plague, as good flour cannot be made from smutty wheat. Although new books on agriculture are con- tiuuaily coming out, there ap- A Manual of pears to be a very fair demand Agriculture, for each as it appear?, and therefore I suppose farmers are eager and willing to store their rfliads with in formation concerning the business of llieir lives. Moss of the recently-published agricultural works haye dealt with rome especial branch or department, such an Warriogton's "" Chemistry of the Farm,"" Aikman's ""Manures and Maaur iog,"" a uew and revised edition of JoLnatono'fl | "".Agiicultural Chemistry"" (a larger and more I prettntioui work than Wswringiou's), Wallace's j ""British Farm Live Stock,'' and numbers of : treaties on sheep and bo s.s, to ssy nothing of i pamphlets on Migar teet culture, olover grow • ing, cheep dipping, &c. The latest addition to ' my littl<s library of. rural literature ia a neat volume, of 300 pa.^cs cut tied "" Agriculture,"" by R Hcdger WJ la.cc, late lecturer *nd examiner in agriculture 'to the Education department of Victoria and the Victorian Department of Agriculture. It is published by W. and It. Chambors, Edinburgh, and I need only say that the general appearanca aud get-up of the book is excc'ltnfc in every resptefc. The author saji lhaf; the book has bean written with the object; of giving a s'mple statement tf the principles of agri culture, baaed on g^necal prac ice, and care has also been taken to make it useful and service able a? a manual or text book in any of the colonies. As each branch of agriculture ia I order to be"" dealt with in a full and complete ' m tuner requires the com pa a j of a good-sized | volume it follows tbat when a comparatively 6m ill book undertakes to cover tho whole ; gr.,uud of seiei title and prac'ical agriculture ifc j must, aiid can, only touch very briefly upon the i various sections. The author does not j profess to have dealt with hh sub i jeefcs in any but an elementary manner, • and says that ths book will be found suitable for the teacher, student, or general reader, as giving a fair elementary idea of tho principles of agriculture. I may *ay that I I have looked carefully th-ongh it, and am much i pleased with ths pl*in and simple marinar in which a great de*l of information is put into a sma!l space. The chapters on soil, germina tion, draining, cultivation, growth of plant*, &;•., are very mteieitiog and instructive, and I am ture that there are many colonial f Aimers who cannot dUim to know as much about their buniutsj as this modest volume can tell them, eUmentary ss it ii. Tbe latter part of the book deaU with implements and machinery, and though well illusir&t' d, is not, to my mind, nearly so well aud carefully put together as the former part. If a lest book of this kind could be used in our public schools for the upp e r stan dards of boys it would be an excellent thin<f for them aud for the country, »ud our farmers' sons would grow into ytuog farmers having an in telligent knowledge of the many and various method 1 ) by wh : ch Nature is aiding and co operating with them in tho performance of theic duties during each season of the year. 'Potatoes as Stock Feed. A settler having a quantity cf potatoes to sparp, wishes to know in last week's Notes and Q vrips whe her they may be given to horses without mjury. As potatoes are consi dered Che best tuber's that can bo wed ns food for nmu and for all the lower animals, ""Sslt'er"" oan set his mind ab rest about potatoes doiog hi» hor»ss any harm. -A good mauy settlers would bs very glad to bave an over-plus of potatoes to give their stock this ■winter as a substitute fcr grass, which is wo fally scarce ja*t now in"" all districts, and in Eome what little there is is entirely buried'in snow. Potatoes are brirgiog such a poor prica thab it will not pay to send them * long dis tance to market, and feeding to stock is pro bably the best way of using them ; but other roots can be grown at co very mach lees outl*y ia labour that I ehould uot recommend tha practice of growing potatoes for stock feed in eny quantity. The chief defects of the potato as n stock tood are its small proportions of fab and albuminoids. In carbohydrate."", however, ifc is the richest of all the rcot? generally grown on the farm. It? p3rcentago of water is the leant of all the root crop*, being generally about 75 percent., while the turnip has 90 per cent., the mangel 88, the carrot 87, and the parsnip 85. Potatoes contain on'y a trace of sugar, while carrots have about 6 or 7 per cent, of sugar in their composition. If I had my choice of car rots or potatoes for horses I think I should be inclined to prefer carrots, as they make such an excellent laxative for horses ' that are com pelled to' live for the moat part on dry fodder during the winter time, especially those thafc are stabled at n'ght and only get a run on the grass on Sundays. A few pounds of carrota given at euppering time with their hay will Seep their bowels open, and make their coats shine, too, if tha dandy brush is used as it should be. "" Settler "" says that his horses are running on grais, and gcb a few carrots ao well as potatoes. If I were in his plfice I should, under the circumsUnces, \t the pig* hive tho potatoes and give th<s horrcs a little m tq dry food in place of the tuber 3. Riw potatoes re quire a good ration of oats and chsff to keep hor£C3 in good fettle. In the old country potatoes ate pulped for fzttening beasts and milch cow, but they are not largely used fop that purpose, it being cheaper, as I have said, to grow other roots for stock.

212,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,139,AUCKLAND TOPICS.,"Auckland, August 5. Tree annual meeting of the Auckland Racing Club was held yesterday, 'with the somewhat unusual accompaniment of a crowded gathering of members. As a rale our annual meetings are chiefly remarkable for the lack of interest taken in them by members, but when an out sider attempts to get on the committee very lively interest is evinced. Ye3terday Fish monger's owner (Mr H. H. Hayr) disturbed the peace of members desirous of re-election by having himself nominated, and a3 his entry gave seven candidates for the six vacincies a ballot liad to be taken. The new eaudidfite worked hard to secure election, but his opponents were on the alert, and rallied to the meeting in suffi cient force io return the reining members, Messrs Backla-.d, Nathan, Duder, Clark, Kirkwoo'.l, and M'LaughLm. Mr Hayr polled the lowest number of votes, 28, and had to stand down. As tho*ing the Btir up that resulted from the nomination of the defeated candidate,' l may say that"" 128 votes were recorded, as against' 121 last year. The annual re port showed that the added money to the five meetings held duriug the year amounted to £8050, *s against £8900 the previ ius year, and that each year -h.td resulted in a profit, the total gain amounting to £1194 5s Bd, as against. £472 193 4d dviii g the pre:t.ding year. The committee pro misel to alter the conditions of several of the classic races to be rnnNit the Hummer meeting, which it is contemplated will inorea-e the revenue of the club. This means that owners will bave to dig further into their pockets as re gards subscriptions, further payments, &c. The balance sheet showed that £500 had be<m paid off the club's mortgage and that over £900 had been •willed off other debts. The feature nf the sheet, respecting which no explanation was given, con sists in the fast that whereas last year's state ment f-howed only a written-off depreciation of £164 lie ""2d, this year's sheet sets foith that the racecourse buildings in 1894 were valued at £25,800, But have been revalued and estimated as worth only £16,800, but why such lower estimates have been arrived at does not appear. The meeting was got over in decidedly sharp time, the n por t be ing adipted four minutes afeir thecommeuci-inent of business. This was unlucky fonMr E. W. Alison, the Motukorea breeder, who, it will lie if mem beied, so successfully represented the Auckland country clubs at last Racing Conference. Mr Alison succeeded in passing the resolution at the conference to the effect that all moneys received in jockeys' fines and fees should be fully set'forth in a separate balance sheet at the anuual meetings of the .metropolitan clubs so that those interested should be told how the money had been disbursed and the balance invested. In spite of this resolu tion the A. R.C followed last yeai's bab nee sheet and,TOerelj'Bta'ed-that£739l4sstoodtothecreditof the Distressed Jockeys' Fund and that £101 8s had besn diibursed. Mr Al son naturally went to yes'e-day'« meeting prepared to take the A. R.C. committee to task for their neglect to follow *he l*\vs of th* conference, but he arrived a few seconds too late and cauld not get a heating, the balance sheet having been adopted. As the country clubs are now required to forward fire 3 received from jockeya to the metropolitan club, it is easy to understand tbe anxiety of their delegate to know exictlyhnw that money 13 expevdel. There has been little or no straight-out betting re the O.J.C. National meeting. Personally my Steeplechase fancy is Norton, wi h Roscius as the best -outsider ; liurdles, Liberator or Victim; SViuter, VogengangorEnfisld; Steeples, Marechal Niel. • By the way, how Christchurch c»n say, .as they are doing, -that Nero will beat Marechal Niel pases comprehension, as here the latter gave Nero two stone and a-half and ran him closß over three .miles cross-country. The journey now is over two miles— all in favour of the Marechal. Nero has to concede lib. With a stand up Marechal will win. It has been rumoured down Napi-r way that Mr Gullau has bought Mutiny, but Mr Douglas denies the statement. North Atlantic is doing very uneven work at Napier, showing up well one morning, and all to pieces the day 'following. Our Cup candidates are doing steady work, and St. Regal is showing great improvement, as is also Pegasus. • St. Patrick, the St. Leger— Steel-all horse, in the St. Clrments stable has been put to a jump ing game, with every promise of success. St. Hippo's full bister Roic had the bad luck to slip twius to Cuirass : er List week. Two local foalingß expected this week are Snnrise (Rama Rama— Awatea), to Castor, at Wellington Park, anrl Phantom, to Regal, at Motukorea stud. Although Lottie did not pay up for the New Zu.tlaud Cup, she is due to leturn to Ellerslie to morrow, and will be accompanied by the Yatten feldt and Ntlson three year-old Commodore, who will be found a vastly-improved colt this yeir. Impulse is doing capital work at -his private training ground, and should nothing befall him in his preparation he will be terribly hard to beat in the big November handicap. Portion of the Sterncbaser commission re the New Zealand Cup was worked locally, Mr J.

268,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,195,Chapter 111.,"LIAN BURNS waa committed for trial on the finding of the coroner's jury. No one ex pected anything else, bo no one was disappointed. Saxon went to the office, but be could not work. In the midst of eetting his mind would wander, and he would put in words of which the author was perfectly guiltless, and which passed the ordinary bounds of printer's errors. The ' reader ' com plained that such black proofs had never be fore passed through his hands. "" They are a disgrace to the office,"" he said plaintively. The overseer remonstrated. Saxon promised to do better, bat his mind was elsewhere, and he found it impossible to fix it on his me chanical occupation. ""I will take a week's holiday, boss,"" be Baid. "" Put a grass* on my f rams, and I will hunt for the man in the I'ght coat."" And so it was arranged. The men in the composing .room were sympathetic, but in credulouß. They were sorry for Saxon, but they did not believe his story. It waa perhaps the knowledge of this that made it impossible for him to work"" among them. His mind, too, was wracked and tossed by the thought of the evidence which he had been forced to give at th^jjouit of inquiry. If be had tied the rope round Lil's neck with bis own handß, he felt that he oould not have done it more thoroughly. And yet what else could he have said ? Oonld he have taken perjury on his soul and sworn falsely before God and man ? Sometimes he thought that he ought to have done so ; that it would have been the lesser of two evils. And thus he learned what we all learn sooner or later : that the right and the wrong paths are not so widely separated and so clearly defined- as some religionists would have us believe. It is not bo much the difference be tween the wide and tho narrow ways as be tween two, equally narrow, equally tortuous, beset with thorns and brambles, and leading — who can say whither ? He asked himself the question which all earnest seekers must sometimes ask them selves : Is there such a thing as absolute right and wrong 2 la not the right always tainted with evil 2 and is there not a soul of good even in that which is vile 2 Is absolute truth possible in this world ? And if not, where should we draw the line 2 These ethical questions tortured him ; they returned to his mind again and again, and he could not answer them or set his soul at rest. It seemed to him that if he had told a lie at once, and sworn that he was on the spot before Lil, who had only come at his call, that be would have saved her and done a great good at the expense of a little wrong, which would have hurt no one but himself, and not even himself over much, It was a Terrible Temptation— none the less bo be cause he did not at the time realise its deadly nature ; and it returned again and again and tortured him almost beyond endurance, so that the sedentary, monotonous life became for the time unendurable. 11 1 could have Bayed her, and did not I "" This was the burden of the cry, and nothing would quell the taunt but the knowledge that he was working to cave her from the awful Impending fate. "" If I could establish her innocence before the magisterial inquiry and bo save her from the disgrace of a public trial, that would be something,"" But how could he do this while he stood hour after hour at his frame in the printing * A temporary lubstitu.to, office and picked up stamps and spaces with the mechanical precision of a ty pa-setting machine. ""To help her I must be free,"" he thought. He had no very distinct idea of how the rescue might be accomplished, but that one thing wae clearly necessary : freedom to come and go as he thought right ; and so to seek for and follow any clue which might present itself. "" I must go,"" he said. ""If I oan raturn later I will ; if not, you will easily fill up my place."" "" Not so easily but that we shall miss you, naid the manager kindly. "" Yet go if you wish it. I will keep the place open for a cer tain time."" So Saxon put on bis hat and walked out. It was early in the evening — early for a printer, that ig-^-and he felt lika a traant schoolboy as he passed through the lighted streets. 11 1 won't go home,"" he thought — "" I'll go and see her mother ; "" and the suggestion seemed an inspiration. He directed bis steps to a tiny cottage in an irregular row of a suburban street, where no two of the houses were exactly alike, and scarcely any two faced in the Bame direction, owing to the fact that each builder had been bis own architect, and had placed his cottage on that part of the section which appeared the flattest, without regard to unity or the line adopted by his neighbours, To a casual observer it appoared as if these cottsges had been dropped from the sky like meteoric stones, and had anohored themselves where they fell. The one to which Saxon went was the smallest of all, containing only two rooms and a email lean-to kitchen or Ecullery where all the dirty work was done. But every detail both within and without was scrupulously neat and clean ; every bit of brass work shone like molten gold, and the little rango was a miracle of black lead and elbow grease. The widow and her daughter received Saxon in the livirjg room. The girl, who suffered from spine complaint, was propped up in an old but comfortable easy chair, and her thin hands were busied with a piece of fine knitting. The mother sat on a little wooden stool beside the fire, and held her bony, shrivelled, claw-like hands over the black grate as if the very blood in her veins were frozen. She said "" Gome in "" when Saxon knocked, but did not rise to admit him, and it seemed to him that a faint wave of disappointment passed over both faces when th&y saw who it was, as if they had expected a different visitor. He shook hands with each, and then drew forward a chair and seated himself. After the first conventional greetings an embarrassed silence fell on the trio. They were too near the heart of the tragedy to speak of anything else, and their feelings on the subject were too intense to find a ready vent in words. It was the first time tbat Saxon had seen them since the inquest, and all at once it struck him that thoy were angry with him because of the evidence he had given. This naturally increased his embarrassment. He wished he had not come. The click of Susie's needles sounded in the stillness as she counted out an elabo rate pattern ; and the crackle of wood in the stove and the buzz of a fly "" i' th' pane "" were painfully audible. He began to wonder what he should say and why he had come — mental questions which are in themselves a com plete bar to conversation. At last Mrs Burns spoke. She was old to be the mother of two such daughters, but she had married late in life, and as her husband had been an invalid, trouble and hard work had aged her before her time. She looked 80, but she was barely 65, and for some years had been entirely dependent on the earnings of her elder daughter. Her face waa old, lined, withered, cris-crossed by a thousand wrinkles, but her eyes were still bright — in tensely so when contrasted with the bushy white brows. She spoke with a strong ScotDh accent which some of the younger generation conld hardly understand. "" And so you've come at last,"" she said in a condemnatory tone, shakicg her gray hair. "" I wanna' ye wasna shamit."" "" Oh, Mr Saxon is too busy to waste time on his old friends,"" said Sasie in a flippant, aggressive manner, raising her bead from the counting, and then resuming, "" One, two, thread before, purl two."" Saxon saw that they were annoyed, but his heart bled so for their trouble that he did not resent their conduct as he otherwise might have done. He leant forward with his elbows on his kne6s, twirling his Btiok aimlessly in his hands, and looking on the ground aa he put the question : 11 Have you seen^Lil 1 "" "" Ye?,"" said Susan quickly. "" Mother was there to-day, but she couldn't get anything out of her ; she seemed dazed-like and not to understand what she was accused of. Ob, Mr Saxon, what a trouble this is for all of üb,"" and Sasan began to weep copious tears of self-pity. "" Whist 1 whist ! "" said the old mother ; "" ehe'll be free in a few weeks. Ye mind what he said."" ""What who said 2"" questioned Saxon quickly. Bat the -woman did not answer. Susan continued to weep in an aggressive manner, which made Saxon feel guilty without know ing exactly why, and the mother stared lit the black stove. It was impossible to avoid coming to the conclusion that the women resented bis presence, and perhaps even desired his absence. He rose from his seat. "" Weel, if ye maun be gayin' widow with alacrity. •"" said the "" I'm in no hurry,"" said Saxon, suddenly remembering why he had come, and again Beating himself. "" Have you seen the lawyer — Mr Hanson 2 He has promised to take up the case."" "" Yes ; he called th' day, and ar&t a morfc o1o 1 questions. I couldna' understand t'half ."" "" Has he seen Lil 2 "" "" I wasna' epeerin', but na doot he'll lee the lassie — yes, na doot. He seems to me a feckless kin' o' a loon. Shouldna' we ha' come un more knowledgable 2 "" "" He's the cleverest criminal lawyer in town,"" said Saxon warmly. ""He has two cases to anyone else's one, and nearly always secures an acquittal, We should con sider ourselves very lucky that he has taken up the oj,se, and JUe jsfcowa a great Interest in "" May be,"", said the widow indifferently, resuming her old attitude and expression. Susan continued to weep, regarding him furtively from behind her clingy pocket handkerchief. What was wrong with the two ? Some one or something had set thtm against him — but who ? Surely they did not resent the evidence which he had given so unwillingly. He was determined to find out. "" Mrs Burns,"" he said, "" I wish I had not been obliged to say what I did before the coroner ; but you know there was no choice. Tbe law must be obejed."" "" Na doot,"" said the mother indifferently ; "" and it's na sa muckle consequence, ye ken, pair body ; it's an awf u' dispensation, na doot. But it'll a' come richt i' th' hinder end."" "" You don't understand,"" said Saxon pas sionately, losing his self-control as tbe women seemed more and more indifferent. "" I would have given my right hand not to have seen what I did — I would have given both hands. Yes, I would have crippled myself for life rather than have borne witness against her."" A strange, troubled look came over the mother's faca. "" I—lI — I dinna comprehend ye,"" she said tremulously. ""Is there —is there any danger 2 "" ""Dargerl Ob, God 1 you do not then understand."" "" Mother is not strong. She must not be upset,"" Baid Susie quickly. ""The doctor saya there's something wrong with her heart. She must not be upset. Sit down, mother, and don't worry youreelf. It will all come right."" "" Na, na 1 I willna bo treated like a bairn. I will speer the trutb, ye ken — the whole tiuth,"" and she rose from her seat by the stove and came towards Saxon, fixing her sharp, black eyes upon his face, as if to force Eomc- thing from him which he was reluctant to yield. Susan, behind her back, made hiai a feign of caution. He grew more and more confused. What did it all mean 2 At this moment there was a low, cautious knock. Susan heard it, and gave her mother a warning glance. ""Sit down,"" she said, ""and don't be excit ing yourself for nothicg."" The old woman obeyed shrinking back into an attitude of cringing submission. "" Shall I answer the door for you 2 "" said Saxon, knowing with what difficulty Bho moved on her crutches. "" No, thank you. It is just — jast a friend. He will wait."" Tbe meaning of all this was so evident that Saxon could no longer pretend to misunder stand it. "" I must be going,"" he said. "" Good-aven ing, mistress ; good-evening, Susie."" He shook hands with them, and noticed that while the mother's claw-like fingers were cold as ice, Susie's palm burned with inward fever. Neither of the women pressed him to lemain or a&ked him to come again. They were evidently only too pleased to get rid of him. He let himself out, accordicg to custom. In the tiny porch a man was standing — evi dently the person who had knocked. He drew on one side into the shadow as he heard Saxon's firm step, and thus allowed him to pass. The printer gave one quick, penetrat ing glance, but saw absolutely nothing though their garments touched, his eyes being dazzled by the sudden darkness. Nevertheless he felt a little curious concern ing this person, for whom the widow and her daughter were evidently waiticg, and as he reached the little garden gate he paused for a moment and looked buck. A streak of light marked the open door, which was, however, so quickly shut that he could distinguish nothing, but as the visitor advanced into the room his black, well defined shadow was thrown on the blind — tbe shadow of a tall, thin man who stooped from the shoulder and carried in one hand a big slouched hat 1 Saxon caught hold of the gate to stoady himself. "" I'll wait till he comes out,"" he said.",0,-1.642104729,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three years later the island was visited by Dr M. Treub, who now reports having found six species of microscopic algae, which coated the rock and seemed to have formed the soil on which eleven species of ferns had taken root. A common grass of Java was growing, and there were quite a number of such species of flowering plants as first appear on coral islands. Seeds or fruit of several coral island trees were found on the shore. Krakatoa is ten miles from the Island of Sibesie, containing the nearest terrestrial vegetation, twenty miles from Sumatra, and twenty-one from Java, INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCE OP THE NOSE. Aprosexie is the name Dr Guye, of Amsterdam, chooses for inattentive ness, and he quite singularly finds that the nose is one cause of it. A dull boy became quick to learn after certain tumors had been taken from the nose; and a man who been troubled with vertigo and buzziag in the ears for twelve years found mental labor easy after a like operation. In a third case, a medical student was similarly relieved.

After prolonged official investiga tion, the most extensive and complete destruction of steam boders on record ihas been attributed to the sudden \ ignition of coal gas, mixed with air, that had accumulated in the flues. The explosion occurred on July 25, 1887, in Upper Silesia, Germany. Twenty-two boilers, each with more than 1000 square feet of heating surface, were instantly blown to pieces, buildings covering half an acre were destroyed, and three men were killed.

139,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,66,OTAGO CENTRAL RAILWAY.,"The petition of Abraham St. George Ryder and 339 other Maniototo residents opposing the suggested diversion of the Ot&go Central rail way at Taieri Lake has leceotly been presented to the Mio inter for Public Works. Attached to the petition is a memorandum showing that the petitioners occupy an aggregate area of 119,444 acres o%J»nd. The petition sets forth that the Obago Central railway is the highway used by the petitioners, a large number of whom are farmers the occu pation and prod ucti vent ss of whose land will constitute the chief source of the traffic and revenue of the line. The engineers of the Public Works department, after careful survey and mature consideration, fixed the route of the railway to traverse the south coast of Taieri lake and to cross the Taieri river at a point about midway between its entiance to the lake and Hamilton bridge. Petitioners believe the work of construction has been suspended at its mo<t advanced point owing to suggestions made of an alternative route deviating from the sur* veyed course at or near the most advanced point, crossing the Taieri river immediately at its outlet from the lake and thence travers ing the north instead of the south coast of the lake. Many of the petitioners 'acquired land from the Crown understanding the railway would traverse the surveyed route, and that its construction would proceed without delay, and therefore any such deviation, if made, would be most unjust and unfair to many of the petitioners. The contemplated alteration would make the railway about half a mile longer than by the surveyed route, and thus be the means of levying a perpetual, unnecssary, and unjust tax upon the petitioners and users of the railway in the form of incretsed dues for fares and freights over an additional mile of road, as under the present tariff any fraction of one mile is for the purpose of computing fares and freights counted and charged as one complete milo. The petition then proceeds as follows :—: — That for the purpose of obtaining access to the rail >vay from the north bank of the Taieri river, an excellent ford is available a few chains below the present road crossing near Ryan's, such ford being safe for traffic in time of flood, when the upper crossing is impassable ; also, that such ford is capable of improvement, and thst approaches for wheel traffic could be made to it at comparatively small cost. That the deviation, if made, will not benefit the general public nor your petitioners, nor be of any real advantage to settlers on the east side of the Kyeburn river, who would still have to cross either the said' Kyeburn or else the Taieri river in order, to reach the railway. • Neither will it benefit the townspeople nor residents in the vicinity of Naseby, because their nearest railway station will bs Eweburn. That a cart traffic bridge, which could be built across tbe rocky go'ge of the Ta'eri river imme diately below the junction of the Kyeburn stream with the said river, at a cost of less than £2000— say £2000,— would be a much greater and more general public convenience than tbe suggested deviation of railway; and further^jwhether the railway route is altered or not, yoiir petitioners are of opinion that such a bridge will eventually have to be built at the place indicated, or else a more costly one lower down the river. That one of the disadvantages of the contem plated route would be increased liability to suspension of traffic, danger of destruction or serious damage to the permanent way, embank ru .its, or other railway structures at or near the outlet of the lake at time 3of flood, owing to any one, more or all, of the following causes — viz. : (1] The proximity and simultaneous flooding of tha Taieri and Kyebuvn rivers. (2) The backing up of va-t quantities of otorm or flood waters in the lake to levels at which its volume and force would become irresistible. (3) The probability of a com plete junction between the lake and the Kyoburn swamp being effected by natural forces, destroying the narrow neck of laud upon which tha railway would run after crossing thu Taieri river, as evi denced by the effects or results of recent floods, to obviate which a very expensive viaduct or costly protective works would be necessary. That another of the disadvantages would be the 1o?b of time and money making fresh surveys, preparing plans and specification?, Ac. ; aud more particularly the delay thus caused in opening the railway for traffic to Eweburn. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that you will give these matters your favourable con sideration, and issue instructions that the work suspeuded be resumed forthwith and prosecuted with all possible spied along the present surveyed route, and carried on continuously. Your petitioners also humbly pray that you will be pleased to have the work of building bridges on this section, including those at Hyde sludge chan nel, Coal creek, Capburn, and Taieri river, put in a forward state directly, and prosecuted vigorously in order that the railway may be opened for traffic to Eweburn so coon as possible.",0,-1.662607497,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,7,DUNEDIN.,"(From Our Own Correspondent). The difference between his Honor the Superintendent and his Executive broke out afresh last week, but now happily th*y have been titled over for a short ime at least. It will be fresh in the recol lection of your renders that immediately nn Mr M'Lo-m's departure for England, the Executive elected Mr J. L. Gillies to 611 the vacuib ■office of ■ Treasurer, bnt his Honor, because he had not ber& consult3d refused to recngais* the appointment. Mr Reid after wards took the office, but for reasons that have not heen stated, he also resi rned. Mr Gdnr^e Duncan now tills the office. It is the feeling hei-e, .thafc the present appoint me it shows a si>n of weakness on the part of ths Government, who it- is thought should have insisted upon, the acceptance of Mr J. L billies by his Honor*. Mr Dunca i, it is thought, has not that administrative capacity to entitle him to all the office ; while, on the other hand, Mr Gillies is a tried man, and many recollect his wise *nd economic admini stration some yean ago. The inaction on the part of the Govern ment in reference to the railway matters is regarded with apprehension here, and the feel* feeli'ig is gaining ground they are not earnest in their desire to have railways instituted* It was stated some time ago, that, the -con tract for the construction of the Port Caal m 'M line was to h.tve been signed f-ut iwith, but a3 yet nothing has bee^i done in regard to it. The latest that is known about the matter is an inspired paragraph in the ' Daily Tunes,' which stv-es ill -it the draft aj;rdemenb between Mr Proivlf >ot the contra tor, having heen duly considered by the legal Ad visers of both parties, the matter will be again t <l ken into con*ide""ation by the Go vernment at once, and deiniteiy settled. Mr Proudfoot is prepared to si^n on condi tion that the Government undert ikes to pro cure an Act of the General Assembly autho rising, the Government to set apart the mon eys and the block of land as seouritj for the interest — a condition to which the Superin tendent obj 'Cts, on the ground that the Act is nnn cessary, Mr John B-vrr, the Provin cial Eugineer, has been apponted by the Government to act as consulting engineer on their behalf. The c mferen^e of Golrlfields Wardens hat conciivded its labors. The new regulation* as drafted by them involve some radical cnanges. and comprise — Ist. R -gulations for the Ota-^o goldfields ; 2nd, G""ld mining lease regulations ; and 3rd, relating to agricul tural leases on the < 'tago goldfielda. Tney have not jet been published as stated by the ' Daily Time 3,' but will he printed in the next issue of the * Gazette.* The movement for the settlement of Mar tinis Bay and Preservation Inlet is progres sing, and judging by present appearances, the first party of pioneer settlers, who are expected to sail in a couple of weeks, will be numerous. A meeting of '* intending set* tiers "" was held a few evenings ago. The meeting was addressed hy Mr M'lndoe, who appeared to think that in th« course of time thriving settlements would be established at both places, but stated he had an objection to Martin's Bay on account of the shallow entrance into the harbor. Some speakers, notably a Mr M'Leod, condemned the whole affair, and the inevitable Mr Jas. G. S, Grant characterised it as an "" attempt to de lude the unwary "" Mr MV e>d s descrip tion of Martin's Bay was thus : 'He was one of the few who accompanied the Government expedition without putting the country to expense ; described the entrance to the river At Martin's Bay as being very bad, and the surrounding country as unfit for settlement. The captain of the steamer Geelong Would I not take her in unless the then Government I would be responsible; they wouldn't, but landed in a boat, and were oapsieed, and one of them nearly lost his life. While there he did not see the sun,— (Laughter) ' But against this was the experience of several practical men, amongst them being a master mariner, who confirmed all that Mr M'lndoe lad stated, and said he navigated through the entrance of the river at the head of Martin's Bay, a sailing vessel with a draught of eight feet. Possibly there are some in the several listricts in which the ' Bruce Herald ' circu lates, who may think favorably of the scheme. if so, they might derive some information :rom what Mr Ashcroft. M P. 0., one of the promoters, stated at the meeting referred to. tie said that pers n* wishing to go there mist make up their minds for hard work, and not to return at once and say they had >een disappointed H j sh< u'«i I c very sorry f he were the •■ cans of getting any person &o form an exaggerated notion of the in* tended settlements. From evideute takem jjfore a Select Committee of the Provincial Council appointed to enqu.re into the ex ediency of forming settlements ou the W«tl loast, he read extracts, to show that itpos essed good hlapbors ; that Martin j^ajr was cry eligible^for a^rieu]turai'setlfoiSpp|, as he soil was^;* rich alluvial and- vl^stifcle eposit, princ^)^ly covered .with heATy tim -er, conswting of totara. whifeat. blatfk, * u « «d pine, aud ra»a; that tke^were about ;00,000 acres of laiid availably for ural settlement : and a» 'tdi the miners .ealth of the place, Dr Hector had w»por« 4 'that there were good indications of the existence of mineral lodes which h^ve nofc yet been sufficiently investigated ; "" that the terraces are similar in character to the auri ferous terraces further lip the coast ; that there was abundance of building stone ; that though the Weather was rather wet, it was very mild ; that the climate was suitable for growing cereals, ,and that in 1863, when the mean temperature ""in Dunedin was 44.1. at the West Coast it was 49 3. He thought he had quoted enough to show that there was a large amount of country ready to settle on. The Government would give 100 acres of lan i to any one who would settle down there for two years. The cost of the passage would depend entirely on the number of persons going. He thought it would be better to send a steamer, as, though cheaper at first in a sailing vessel, there would ultimately be a pain in the saving of time. Unless he could get a large number of passengers, the charge would not be less than L 6. The Go vernment were going to send down a survey ing staff, and he believed that thoße parties who wished to have land surveyed quickly, would have to render assistance to the sur veyors in cutting the lines. At the last meeting of the City Corpora tion, a letter was read from the lessee of the gas works, offering to sell his interest in the present works, and contracts for public and private lighting, for £.10,000. It is, how ever, highly improbable that the offer will be accepted. Tenders for the erection of the ■new works will be opened in a week. At the same meeting a letter was read from the manager of the Bank of Otago, intimating that the Corporation's overdraft amounted to something like £3000. It must not how ever be supposed that the Corporation is again in a state of bankruptcy, for in a few days it will have some £70C0, accrued rents from the Princes street reserve placed to its credit Many people have doubtless asked when will the authorised reports of the proceed ings of the late session •of the Provincial Council be published ? lam in a position co state that they will make their appearance in about a fortnight. The delay in the pub lication is owing to the want of proper paper, and members not returning the "" proofs "" of their speeches to the printers. ■Some little consternation was caused a few evenings ago by the reported stoppage 'of Mr Court, lessee of Ihe Princess Theatre and proprietor of the Provincial Hotel. The re port was but too true : and the same evening the theatre closed, and thus some forty per sons were thrown out of employment. The hotel was closed the next day, and it and the theatre will be sold next week, to satisfy the claims of the Bank of Otago, the holders of a bill of sale over the property- The principal members of the theatre company go to Canterbury. The manufacture of glue is about to be started here by Mr G. Beissel, who at the Exhibition of 1865 gained honorable mention tor glue prepared here, which was pronounced to be equal to imported glue.

372,1892-05-31,HBH,Hawke's Bay Herald,10,UNTITLED,"AN ACRE LICENSING DISTRICT. Froclamations in the Government Gazette, couobed in strictly official pedantic phraseology, oftentimes mean a good desi more than appears npon tbe surfa.ee. In a late issue of the Gazette there appeared a proclamation revoking a previous Order-iu-Coancil under the Licensing Act as tar as relates to a section of land one acre in extent. The New Zea land Herald lets a flood of light on this ap parently innocent proclamation. Wben the Licensing Aot of 1881 was before Parliament there was some discussion about the prohibition of licenses to sell alcohollo liquors in native districts. The result was that the following olause was added :— The Governor, on the application of the owners of any block or area of native land on which no publican s license has been bitherto granted, may, by proclamation in the Gazette, declare that no license aball be granted within such block or area, and it shall not be lawful for the licensing committee to issue any license to take effect within any block or area so proclaimed. The special objecb of the promoters of this clause was to keep liquor out of the King Country. The Auokland teetotallers took prompt steps to give effect to the clause. A deputation, accompanied by the late Mr C. O. Davis as interpreter, went np to the King Country, aud saw all the .principal chiefs, inoluding Tawhlao, wbo was much less approachable than be ia now. They all signed a petition asking the Governor to issue a proclama tion prohibiting for ever the issue of licenses in tbe King Country. In 1884, a proclamation was issued reciting the section above given, and declaring : Now, therefore I, William Francis Drummond Jervols, the Governor of the colony of New Zealand, do in pursuance and exercise of tbe power fthd authority vested in me by the said Act, hereby proclaim and declare that no license shall be granted within the area of native land described in the said sohedulo. There is no provision in the Acb lor the revocation or alteration of sneh a pro clamation, but the Chief Justice, wbo is an authority on constitutional law, apparently thinks that nono is needed, for in his capacity as administrator in the absence of tbe Governor, be bas signed snotber Order-in. Council, revoking tbe one juab cited, and proclaiming another schedule with this alteration— "" excepting from the above-described area, subdivision C of the Orabiri block, containing by admeasurement one acre."" The preamble declares that the restriction ls removed "" with tbe consent and ab the request of the owners of the land described."" But, according to our Anckiand namesake, the natives who signed the petition for pro hibition In the King Country are still of the same mind, Tbe phrase "" owners of tho land described "" seems to apply only to the owners of the acre defined. These are two half-oastes, and it is said they intend to erect a public-house there. ""The whole thing,"" says our contem porary, "" appears to have been done by the owners of tbe acre. We believe that if the opinion of tbo whole of the native owners of the King Country were taken, it would still be in favor of keeping oub any licensed house, If tbe Government has power to pro_aim any acre in any part of the King Country a licensing district, and to license a house on it, then the former proclamation and tbe clause in the Aot may be swept away altogether. The whole country had better, to save jobbery and corruption, come under tbe ordinary provisions of the Licensing Act.' 1 With this we ontirely agree. Tho last proclamation may be striotly within tho four corners of the law, but tbe framers of that law never inteuded thab such au absurdity should be possible under lt.",0,-1.787876209,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/hawkes-bay-herald/1892/05/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
391,1854-07-08,OW,Otago Witness,4,"INAUGURATION OF THE PRESBYTERY OF OTAGO, NEW ZEALAND.","The Inauguration of the Presbytery of Otago, in « accordance with the public notification to that effect, took place in the church of Dunedin on the 27th ult. Present — The Rev. Thomas Burns, minister ; and his Honor the Superintendent of Otago, elder of the church of Dunedin. The Rev. William Will, minister ; and Mr. John Allan, elder of the church in the Taieri and Waihola districts. And the Rev. William Bannerman, minister of the church in the Tokomairiro and Clutha districts. Besides the members of Presbytery, there were j from 200 to 300 elders and members of the church ! of Otago, including several from the rural districts. The Rev. Thomas Burns conducted public wor ship, and preached the introductory sermon from Hebrews xiii. 17, in which he laid down most clearly the principles of Presbj terian Church Government. At the conclusion of the service Messrs. Will and Bannerman presented their certificates of ordina tion, after which it was proposed by the Rev. Wm. ""Will, seconded by the Rev. Wm. Bannerman, and carried unanimously, "" That the ministers now pre sent, along with such elders as hold commissions from Kirk-Sessions to represent them, do now, by the appointment of a Moderator,- constitute them selves, in the name of the Head of the Church, a Presbytery, by the name and title of ' The Presby tery of the Church of Otago,' and that they appoint the Rev. Thomas Burns to be their Modeiator; 1 ' which proposal having; been unanimously agreed to, Mr. Burns took the Chair. A portion of the 122 nd Psalm having been sung, the Moderator engaged in prayer, after which he delivered to the Presbytery a most able and suitable address. He shewed that there are very special S grounds in the first origin and past history, and present condition, of the Church and Colony of Otago; why eveiy inhabitant of the Settlement should feel himself bound by every principle of honour, as well as by every regard to duty and the best interests of himself and of the community to which he belbngs, to give his most strenuous and unwearied efforts to secure the inestimable common advantage— that the people of Otago shall be a thoroughly united people. He next proceeded to press the same threat object upon higher and moie sacred grounds — viz., the strong obligations to Christian union. The Moderator having intimated that the Pres bytery would now proceed to business, by the ap pointment of a Clerk, it was moved by the Rev. Wm. Bannerman, seconded by the Rev Wni. Will, and adopted— That John M'Glashan, Esq., Provin cial Solicitor, be requested to give the Presbytery his assistance by officiating in that capacity. Mr. M'Glashan being present, and the Moderator having intimated to him his appointment, he signi fied his acceptance of the office ; and having promis ed faithfully to discharge the duties, took his seat j accordingly. The commissions of Elders having been called for, were given in and sustained, and the roll of members of Presbytery declared. Tiie Moderator* then called the attention of the Presbytery to the importance of having, in the pre sent circumstances of the Church, a Legal Adviser ; and his Honor the Superintendent moved— That Mr. John M'Glashan be appointed Procurator to the Church of Otago ; and further, that in conse quence of the peculiar duties of the Procurator in connection with the Church at the present time, the Procurator be requested to take his seat as a .con stituent member of Presbytery ; which motion being carried. Mr. M'Glashan took his seat accordingly. It was moved by the Rev. Wm. Will, seconded by his Honor the Superintendent, and unanimously resolved — That the Presbytery now constituted, considering the fundamental and important nature of the subjects to which they will be called upon to deliberate, and that a number of office-bearers, and of individuals who were office-bearers in the mother Church and in sister Presbyterian Churches in the mother country, and are now members of the Church of Otago, are present, do request all such office bearers, members of this Church, and also such pro bationers and students of Divinity, as were formerly connected with any of said Churches, and are now members of the Church of Otago, to sit along with the members of Presbytery at this and subsequent sederunts, to assist with their advice in all matters to come before the Presbytery, to the glory of God and the good of the Church. They having been invited to give in their names, the following individuals took their seats with the Presbytery accordingly :— Rev. Robt. Hood, Messrs.

The Presbytery then proceeded- to appoint Com mittees for the following objects : — To arrange the business of the Presbytery; to prepare an Address to Her Majesty, and also to His Excellency the Officer administering the Government of New Zea land, and to the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland ; and further, to prepare a Pas toral Address to the Members' of the Church of Otago. It was then moved by his Honor the , Superinten dent, seconded by the Rev. Mr. Will, and unani mously resolved— That the Moderator be authorized, by letters to be addressed to the Ministers of the Presbyterian Churches in New Zealand, to inform these Churches of the erection of this Presbytery, to express the deep interest which the Ministers and Members of this Church feel irr the welfare of the Presbyterian Churches of New Zealand; and that it is the fervent prayer of this Presbytery that the Lord would be pleased greatly to bless the ef forts of the Ministers, Office-bearers, and Members of these Churches, for the advancement of pure and undented religion in the portions of these Islands with which they are connected ; in which hallowed work this Church earnestly desire the fellowship and co-operation of the said Churches, as far as may be practicable in present circumstances; hoping and praying that in His own good time, and at no dis tant period, through the favour of the Great Head of the Church, a closer union of these Churches and this Church may be consummated. The report on the Sustentation Fund was then given in by Mr. James Adam and read, and its con sideration adjourned till the evening sederunt, the Moderator requesting Mr. John Gillies to address the Presbytery on the subject at that sederunt. The Presbytery then adjourned till the evening. EVENING SEDERUNT. The Presbytery again met at half-past six, the Moderator in the chair ; and after being constituted with devotional exercises, the minutes of the former sederunt were read and approved of. The Rev. Mr. Bannerman rose to propose the following resolution, which he was sure would be cordially responded to : — That the Presbytery record their thanks to the Reverend the Moderator for the suitable and impressue sermon delivered by him at the opening of the Presbytery this day, and also for the seasonable address delivered by him from the Moderator's chair, on the origin, character, and progress of the Otago colony, and the duty of the colonists in connection therewith ; and further, that the Moderator be requested to give the address for publication. This motion having been seconded by Mr. Allan, was cordially responded to and adopted. The Moderator having called upon the Commit tees who had been appointed at the former sederunt, to give in their reports, the following Addresses were read, adopted, and appointed to be extended, signed b} r the Moderator, and forwarded in the usual manner: — To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty. May it please.your Majesty, We your Majesty's most loyal and dutiful sub jects, the Ministers and Elders of the Church of Otago, New Zealand, in Presbytery assembled, seize with joy the occasion of our being constituted into a Church Court for the first time, of laying at the foot of the Throne the assurance of our devoted loy alty and attachment. Though our lot be cast far distant from our na tive land, and the seat of government of the British Empire, we cleave to our Sovereign and her Throne with unswerving constancy, cherishing, in common with the people under our care, a deep seated love of our country and of the British Constitution. As the Ministers and Elders of a Church of Christ, it shall be our unceasing endeavour, whilst we dis charge our spiritual functions, to impress on the consciences of her Members the inestimable advan tages under which we live as British subjects, and the obligation of rendering dne obedience to the Chil pownr, as a duty demanded by the highest of all authority, and by a regard to the peace and pros perity of this colony. That every temporal and spiritual blessing may ever attend your Majesty, your Majesty's Royal Consoit, and every Member of the Roj-al Family — th.it a lo\g continued course of prosperity, adorned and blest by graces, and virtues, and wisdom, shin ing through the example of your Majesty's life, may continue to enthrone your Majesty in the hearts of your subjects more and more — and that after a long, prosperous, and peaceful reign on earth, you may receive a crown of eternal glory, is the earnest and united prayer of, . May it please your Majesty, The Ministers and Elders of the Church of Otago, New Zealand, in Presbytery convened. Signed in our name and presence, &c. Thomas Burns, Moderator. To Hrs Excellency The Officer Administering the Government of New Zealand. May it please your Excellency, l We the Ministers and Elders representing the Presbyterian Church of Otago, in Presbytery"" con vened, rejoice in the opportunity afforded, for the first time, by the Constitution of this our Church Court, of presenting to your Excellency, as her Ma jesty's Representative, the assurances of our heart felt loyalty to her Majesty's person and Government, and of our respect for your Excellency. It is a source of peculiar satisfaction, and of the liveliest gratitude to Almighty God, that peace and good order universally prevail in this distant portion of Her Majesty's Dominions. \Ye ascribe this under God to the diffusion of civi lization and religious knowledge among the Abori ginal Inhabitants, and to the large measure of civil and religious liberty which it is the happiness of the colonists to enjoy, in common with her Majesty's subjects in all parts of the British Empire. While we are fully -persuaded that the more the freedom of our institutions is perfected, the greater will be the contentment of the inhabitants of this colony, and of their attachment to her Majesty's Government, we no less firmly believe that the "" Righteousness which exalteth"" a nation "" is the surest bulwark of a people's welfare and of a mo narch's throne. It is therefore our earnest desire, and shall be our tinwearied endeavour, in dependence on Divine Grace, to diffuse among 1 the people of this Pnmnce under our care, the spirit of enlightened and fervent piety, the only source of pure moral conduct, and of cheerful submission to lawful authority. ' - 'That your Excellency may be upheld, amid' t 'the cares of Government, and guided in a course of'be neficent administration of the affairs of New Zea land, is the earnest prayer'of, ► May it please your Excellency, The Ministers and Elders of the Church of Otago, in Presbytery assembled. Signed in our name and presence, &c. ""■ Thomas Burns, Moderator. To the Venerable The General Assembly of the Free Church op Scotland,, The Presbytery of the Church of Oatgo, in New Zealand, wish Grace, and Mercy, and Peace, from God the Father and from the Lord JesUs Christ. We eagerly embrace.beloved brethren, the occa sion of our being constituted, for the first time, into a Church Court, after the model of the constitution of the Church of our fathers, to express our, undi minished, cordial, and cherished attachment to the great principles for the maintenance of which you were forced to abandon your connection with the Established Church; our' joy at the continued and growing success with which her Divine Head has blessed the Free Church of Scotland ; and our ear nest prayer that He may be pleased still more abun dantly to render her a' praise and blessing to our native land. We rejoice in the interest in this colony, which, in the adorable Providence of God, has been mani fested by the Free Church of Scotland, especially in having, in her own straits, soon after the disruption, transferred to this settlement the services of one of her ordained ministers, upon the ground of his pecu liar qualifiations for the important station he was called upon to occupy ; and, latterly, in considera tion of our growing numbers, and increasing spirit ual wants, sending to labour amongst us in holy things two other most acceptable servants of God. While humbly acknowledging the gratitude due to Almighty God for the signal tokens of Divine fa vour, in these and other' respects, with which the Church of Otago has been visited, we desire to con vey to you, with heart-felt thankfulness, the expres sion of the high gratification which the formation of the first Presbytery of our Church in this colony af fords to all her Members — and our earnest hope and prayer that .the Free Church of Scotland will con tinue to vouchsafe to us, as occasion may require, that countenance and sympathy so animating and consolatory, and those supplies of godly ministers so essential to the nourishment and growth of the infant Church in this place. It is our decided con viction, founded on our colonial experience,- that the interests of vital Religion in this colony imper atively demand the selection of Ministers graced with piety, undoubted talent, and devoted zeal for their Master's work. With cordial sentiments of esteem and affection, and with fervent prayer that God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ may cause his richest blessing to descend upon our native land ; and upon you and all the Office-bearers and Members of the Free Church of Scotland ; and upon all your labours and undertakings for the promotion of His cause, We remain, dear Brethren, Yours in our common Lord, The Ministers and Elders of the Church of Otago, New Zealand, in Presbytery convened. Signed in our name and presence, &c. Thomas Burns, Moderator. The Procurator, in moving the adoption of the Address to the Free Church of Scotland, remarked that it had been prepared by the Lay Members of Committee. The allusion it makes to the 'Rev. Mr. Burns was a mere fact,. a quotation from the Mi nutes of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland ; and the allusion to the other two Mi nisters, Messrs. Will and Bannerman, h the state ment of another fact, not so much by way of compli ment to them, or because due to them, as because it "" is right that the Colonial Committee of the Church at home, and the Church at large, should know that we are fully satisfied with the manner in which the important trust of choosing Ministers for us lias hitherto been discharged. (Applause.) The Moderator then called upon the Rev. Wm. Will to address the meeting, when he -delivered a most excellent and appropriate address on the dis tinethe principles and claims of the Free Church of Scotland. Commencing with the first dawn of the Reformation in Scotland, he traced its progress up to the time of the Disruption ; and having proved most satisfactorily that the Free Church of Scot land was no other than the Church of the Reforma- v tionj he argued at some length in favour of a union between all Evangelical Presbyterians in this Set tlement, irrespective of denominational distinctions. The Rev. Wm. Bannerman, in a few remarks, il lustrated and enforced the same subject. Although there were slight differences of opinion between the various denominations of Protes'ants, yet he could see no objection on the part of any Evangelical"" Pro testant from joining the Presbyterian Church of Otago. He concluded by moving the thanks of the Presbytery to the Rev. Wm. Will, which was un animousiy agreed to, and tendered accordingly. . The Report on the Sustentation Fund having been again read, the Moderator called upon Mr. Gillies to address the meeting on the subject. Mr. Gillies having alluded to a meeting of ofßce bearers he had attended not twelve months hack to take measures for providing a gospel ministry in our rural districts— with what fears and misgivings it had then been resolved to apply, and undertake, by a general Sustentation Fund, to provide for two additional Ministers. It was felt by many to be a bold undertaking ; but the Great Head of the Church had seen and owned the desire before it was expressed ; and it proved that at the very time we were thus thinking at the Antipodes, two Ministers were spontaneously and actually ordained for us by the Free C.hureh. On the arrival of these Ministers he had been one of a deputation to the rural dis tricts, for organizing and stimulating the Sustenta tion Fund, and he had now great satisfaction to find, by the first half-year's accounts, which he held in his hands, that in almost every instance the sums spoken of in the several districts had been exceeded, and. that the whole aspect of the Fund gave hopeful indication that the requisite amount of £600 per annum will be realized within the first year. Mr. Gillies' address was animating and instructive, and we only regret our inability to give it in full. The Procurator rose under a deep sense of obli, gation to Mr. Gillies for his very excellent and .sea sonable address. 'He moved that the thanks of the House be given to Mr. Gillies from the Chair, and that the further consideration of'the Report on the Sustentation Fund be adjourned till next day, with a view to the adoption of measures towards placing the' Church's secular affairs generally, and the Sus tentation Fund in particular, on a satisfactory' foot ing ; which motion was seconded by the Rev. Mr.. Bannerman. ' And after the Rev. Mr. Will had en tered into an explanation of the progress of the Sustentation Fund in the Taieri and Waihola dis-, tricts, the motion was put 0 and carried, and the thanks of the meeting tendered by the Moderator to Mr. Gillies. The Rev. Mr. Bannerman intimated thatiie would on the following d*ay -submit to the Presbytery cer tain resolutions on the subject of Education. The sederunt was then closed with prayer, and the Presbytery adjourned till the following day. Wednesday, June 28. The Presbytery again met in the Church at 10 o'clock a.m., the Moderator in the Chair. The meeting having been constituted with devotional exercises, the minutes of former sederunt were read and approved of. I On the motion of the Procurator, the Presbytery I then resolved itself into a Committee of the whole House for the purpose of resuming consideration of the Sustentation Fund Report and the secular af- i fairs of the Church. In Committee the Procurator ! at some length, and in a most able manner, brought under -consideration the necessity of adopting a sys tem of general administration of the secular affairs of the Church; and after very deliberate consider ation and discussion of the whole matter, various propositions were agreed to, and a report in regard i to them adopted. ! The House then resumed, and the following re- i port having been brought up, the Presbytery unani-.| mously adopted the same, and declared the regula- , tions therein contained to be interim regulations for j the guidance of the Church in the management of • its secular affairs, and enjoined that it be read from I the pulpit, its purport explained, and the object strongly recommended : — "" I. — Immediate Dividend. "" That the Presbytery express their high satisfac tion with the interest their Congregations have taken in the Sustentation Fund, and the amount it has reached during the half-year ending June 30, ! 1854; declare the dividend to each Minister to be i £67 ; authorise the Treasurer to pay the same ; and | record their .thanks to the Committee and Mr. James j Adam, who have hitherto, under appointment of the Deacons' Court of Dunedin, acted as the Committee of Management and General Treasurer ""of this Fund, for the services they have rendered in connexion therewith. "" ll.— Secular affairs generally. "" In so far as regards the description and consti tution of the several Boards, to which they consider I it advisable that the administration of the secular affairs of the Church should be entrusted, that the administration of the said affairs shall be divided into five separate Branches, as follows ; — "" (1.) That the first Branch shall consist of a Sus tentation Fund Committee, whose business shall be the in-gathering of the General Fund for the Sus tentation of the Ministry from the various sources from which it must be supplied, organizing associ ations, and keeping in active and vigorous operation the whole machinery for collecting the contributions of the Church to that Fund. This Committee shall have a separate Convener and Secretary, and an adequate staff of agency sufficient for the great ob ject committed to their charge. "" (2.) That there shall be a Board of Trustees, as the legal hand to hold the Church Lands, and all other realized property connected with the Church .as places of worship, &c, to be vested in them at as early a period as circumstances will admit of. "" The Church Land Estate is already vested in Trustees ; l -fljut it Is advisablp that a new and enlarg ed Board shall be constituted with adequate powers. The nature and extent of these powers, and the mode by which they are to be acquired, will demand very special consideration. This matter, it is pro posed, shall be- remitted to a special Committee, viz. : — The Moderator, the Rev t Messrs. Will and Bannerman, His Honor ihe Superintendent, the Procurator, Mr Allan and Mr. John Shaw, of the Clutha district, with power to consult and advise with the present Trustees, and to call in such other assistance as they may think fit, and if needful, to suggest to the Moderator to call a. pro re nata meet ing of Presbytery to consider any definite measure which may be matured. "" All that can be determined on this subject, therefore, at this time, is a general outline of the principal features of the system that should be adopted by means of such a Board, viz. : — That to the Trustees shall belong the charge of all matters connected with titles, conveyances, and transfer ences. It is most important that the Church pro perty should be so vested, and a Board of Trustees is the proper and legitimate body to hold this pro perty ; but only at same time as the hands of the Presbytery, or other superior Church Court, as such other superior Church Court shall arise. | "" (3.) That in respect to the administration of ""the annually accruing General Fund, the Presby tery reserve to itself this branch of administration. "" (4.) That in addition to these General Boards there shall be Local Bodies to take charge of the secular affairs of each Congregation, viz., the seve ral Deacons' Courts chosen by the Congregations ; and their administration of these affairs should be conducted in accordance with general regulations to be hereafter agreed to. If in any instance it be im possible to accomplish the formation of a Deacons' Court, the Elders alone shall attend to these mat ters ; every exertion, however being made to erect a Deacons' Court as early as possible. "" (5.) That there shali further be a separate Com mittee for revising and checking accounts, having these properly audited, vouched, and published,- and seeing that the whole administration of the Funds is in accordance with the. rules laid down for the guidance of the respective Committees. "" (6.) That there shall be a general Treasurer, who shall keep the accounts of the general funds of the Church, and receive and pay away the same according to rules for his guidance, to be hereafter adopted ; and Mr. W. H. Reynolds is strongly re commended to be elected General Treasurer. "" Such are the main features of the system re 'qommended. Important and numerous details are still to bfi filled in, and regulations to be adopted. The preparation of these will require great care, attention, and time, and^ can be reported only to a future meeting of Presbytery. The Moderator should be empowered to call a pro re nata meeting of Presbytery for that purpose, and meanwhile the j several Boards recommended to be formed^ should be appointed, and authorized to act on such interim rules as they may deem suitable in the circum s£ances. "" III.— SUSTENTATION FUND. "" that in regard to the machinery for raising and administering the Sustentation Fund, the following particular regulations be adopted : — "" (1.) That the plan already set on foot by office bearers of this Church, in raising a Central Susten tation Fund for the support of Ministers, by the payment to them therefrom of an equal dividend, is worthy of the confidence of this Church, and ought to be adhered to. "" (2.) That the movement for realizing this Fund, so as to secure thereby a minimum dividend of £200 per annum to each Minister be vigorously prose cuted through means of Deacons' Courts, and, where necessary, by district associations. "" (3.) That the following individuals be appointed a Sustentation Fund Committee, five of whom shall j form a quorum : — Rev. Mr. Burns, Dunedin ; Rev. Mr. Will, Taieri and Waihola ; Rev. Mr. Banner man, Tokomairiro and Clutha; Messrs. John Gil lies, Half-way Bush ; George Fhand, East Taieri ; j William .Stevenson, East Taieri; John Shaw, Clutha ; John Salmond,- Tokomairiro ; George Turnbull, East Taieri ; William White, Waihola ; James Elder Brown, Anderson's Bay ; William Smith, North-East Valley; Robert Hood, Half way Bush : David Andrew, Green Island Bush ; Henry Clark, Caversham ; George Hepburn, Half- I way Bush ; John Cargill, Tokomairiro ; William I Mills, Port Chalmers; James Macandrew, Dunedin ; ' William Hunter Reynolds, do. ; John M'Glashan, •I do. ; Captain William Cargill, do. ; James Adam, I do. ; Charles Robertson, do. ; Alexander Rennie, do. j That Mr. John Gillies be their Convener and Secre- o 1 tary, and that there be appointed from each Congre | gation a corresponding member of the said Commit tee, whose name shall be reported to the Convener. "" (4.) That in the Pastoral Letter to the Mem bers of this Church, appointed to be issued, the duty of contributing to this Fund be expounded and en forced ; and that when the said Letter is issued and read from the pulpit, each minister at the same ! time specially direct the attention of his people to i their duty and privilege in contributing to the said I Sustentation Fund, as a chief means, under God, of j supporting the Ordinances of the Gospel throughout this Province. "" (5.) That with a view to induce the Members and Adherents of this Church to discharge their duty in this matter, the Presbytery enjoin the said Committee from time to time to appoint Deputations of their number to visit the different districts and to maintain a system of periodical visitation ; and cn | join the ministers and such elders and deacons as the Committee may apply to, to hold themselves in readiness to assist such deputations in this work. "" (6\) That in such visitations the deputations, if possible, first meet with the Deacons' Court and collectors of each Congregation, ascertain the state of the working and agency of the association, and endeavour to engage the collectors"" in systematic and strenuous efforts. "" (7.) That the Sustentation Fund Committee be enjoined to take all further competent means to se cure the efficient working of the associations, and to promote generally the interests of the Fund."" The Presbytery having then taken into serious consideration the necessity of making a substanthe "" declaration of the principles of this Church, resolved unanimously and enacted — That the fundamental principles of this Church in doctrine, polity, and discipline, are and shall be those laid down in the Standards of the Free Church of ' Scotland, which Standards shall be, and are hereby adopted as, the Standards of this Church. On the motion of the Procurator it was also una nimously resolved and enacted— That considering the desirableness of Heads of Families and other Members and Adherents of this Church being pos sessed of copies of the Subordinate Standards of the Church, such as the Confession of Faith, Larger and Shorter Catechisms, Directory for Public Worship and form of Church Government, agreed on by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster — and under standing that a publication of these in a cheap form has been lately issued in Scotland, enjoin Svirk Ses sions to recommend to the people under their care to possess themselves of copies of said publication, and for that end authorise them to receive subscrip tions for the same at the rate of 2s. 6d. per copy, and appoint Mr. James Adam, Treasurer of the Fund, and the Procurator and Mr. W. H. Reynolds a.s a Committee to act along with him in this matter. The subject of Education was then brought before the Presbytery by the Rev. Mr. Bannerman, agree ably to his intimation at a former sederunt, when, after mature deliberation, it was unanimously re solved — That this Presbytery offer every encourage ment to efforts for promoting the establishment of Elementary and Superior Schools, founded on a broad and liberal basis, for affording instruction I based on religion ; and appoint the_ following Com mittee to deal immediately and decidedly in regard to this most important subject, with a view to the establishing of a satisfactory system of Education, viz. — The Moderator, the Rev. Messrs. Will and Bannerman, the Procurator, the Rev. Robert Hood, and Messrs. James Macandrew, John Gillies, Henry Clark, James Sounness, William Hunter Reynolds ; Mr. Reynolds, Convener. With regard to Sabbath Schools : being deeply impressed with a sense of the duty incumbent on the Church to promote to the uttermost the religious instruction of the youth of this Province, instruct the Ministers to bring this matter under the notice of Kirk-Sessions, and to report to the next ordinary meeting of Presbytery as to the number of Sabbath Schools in operation throughout the bounds of the Presbytery, and the attendance at each. Further, appoint the Modera tor, Messrs. James Adam, Arthur John Burns, Charles Robertson, John Healey, John Curie — Mr. Adam, Convener — as another Committee, to con sider the subject of Sacred Music, with reference to its being made an indispensable branch of Education in Elementary Schools, improving Congregational singing, and introducing the singing of psalms as a part of the worship of God in families. It was then moved by the Rev. Wm. Will, and seconded by the Rev. Wm. Bannerman— That the thanks of the Presbytery be given to the Procurator for his valuable services throughout the whole of the proceedings of this Presbytery ; and in particu lar, for the order and business-like distinctness with which %heae proceedings have been arranged by him, as wdl as for his services as Presbytery Clerk. The whole time available to the Presbytery for considering the affairs of the Church being now ex hausted, various other important matters were de ferred for future consideration. - « s — The Presbytery resolved that their next ordinary meeting shall be held in the Church of Dunedin ""on the last Wednesday of October, which re&olution having been publicly intimated, this sederunt was closed-with prayer.",0,-1.788755839,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1854/07/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
387,1892-05-31,HBH,Hawke's Bay Herald,25,AN AUCKLAND ROMANCE.,"A singular case came before Mr Justice North in England a short time ago. In 18S5 Mr Benjamin Duvall died. He U-ft his son, F. D. Duvall, the income of £5000 for life, with remainder to his widow, and after her the children. This Duvall resided in New Zealand, where for ten years he had lived with a lady who passed as his wife, and by whom he had two children. He made his will in 1887, appointing a life interest in the £5000 legacy to her, He described her as his wife, and admitted the children were hia. _ He died in 1888, and some doubt having arisen as to his marriage, an action for the administration of the trusls oi the legacy was bronght. Tho chief cleric fonnd against tho existence of a marriage, aud Mrs F. B. Duvall now sought to have this certificate varied and herself declared the lawful wife of the late F. B. Duvall, ond her children his lawful children. The evidence of several reputable persons was tendered, all show ing that the alleged marriage had never had any doubt cast upon it. Mrs Duvall . account of the marriage was decidedly romantic and had better be described in her own words. In her affidavit she declares :— On December 5, 1878, he proposed to tako me for a drive to Onehunga, a village about six miles from Auckland, together with a Mrs Blades, an elderly woman, who was connected in some way with the Prince of Wales Hotel, at which he was living, and I consented and accompanied him and tha said Mrs Blades to Uuebunga as aforesaid in a cab, and during the journey he proposed that we should be married at Onehnnga, and stated that he had mado arrangements for the marriage to take place there on that day. We alighted from the cab close to the railway station, and the cab wss sent away, and shortly after the Auckland train arrived, and a gentleman who from his dress and sppearance I was satisfied was a clergyman, Came ont of the railway atation and shook hands with mo and talked apart to tho said Frederick Benjamin Duvall, and I was then introduced to this gentleman, and io was explained that he was to marry üb. I then had a conversation witb the said Y. B. Duvall, and, after his entering into a promise to abstain from drink, I consented to marry him, and about half an hour afterwards the said F. B. Duvall took me to a cottage in the vicinity, where luncheon had been prepared for us, and after luncheon the clergyman came into the honse, and the said P. B. Duvall told him we were prepared for the ceremony, and the clergyman said he required two witnesses, ond sent the woman out for two men who were work ing on tho road close by, and when the men came in tbe usual marriage servioe waa gone through. The ring I had i previously seen was put on my Oncer by the said F. D. Duvall, somo blue papers were produced, and I distinctly remember the Baid F. B. Duvall signing a blue paper raled with celumnß and bear ing a strong resemblance in its appearance to a copy of tbo entry of death I have seen attached to an affidavit sworn in this matter. I never inquired the names of the two witnesses. I did ask the name of the clergyman, but havo forgotten It j but I recollect the said F, B. Duvall Btnting tbat be was on a visit to Auck land, and belonged to one of the southern provinces, and that he had known bim ln Lyttelton. Mr Justice North held that irrespective nf Mrs Duvall's evidence there were many fscts showing that the general reputation was that a valid marriage bad been celebrated, and creating a strong presumption in favor of the applicant. There wero statements before bim which were not consistent with some points in her narrative, hnt even if he camo to the conclusion that her account of th""* marriage was false, or that no marriage was duly solemnised at the time and place she alleged, that woulJ not he enongh to displace the very strong pß<|>umptinn of there having been some valid marriage made between the parties before tho first child wns born. Upon the evidence bofore him he must find in lavor of tho applicant, and vary the chief clerk's certificate. — Auckland Herald.",0,-1.793577671,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/hawkes-bay-herald/1892/05/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

166,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,93,BALD HILL FLAT.,"August 5. — A concert and dance was held here on the evening of Friday in aid of the local school funds, and in spite of the severely cold weather and hard times of enforced idleness was a fair success. Mr F. Gray presided, and the fo'lowing' is a brief sketch of. the programme. Miss Hues ton, piano selection ; MrF. Williams (Alexandra), three Eougg ; Miss Synies, two songs ; Miss and Master Hesson, violin selection ; Mr E Jones, two songs ; Miss J. Carroll, two songs ; Mr W. Vallance, two songa ; Miss Michelle, two songs ; Mr G. Simmonds, two songs ; Mrs R. >ymcs, two eougs ; Mr A. Douglas, two sougs ; Miss Baker, two songs ; Mr P. liahill, two aongs ; Miss and Master Hesson, st ng ; also a banjo song by Mr James Simmonds in character. ■ The accompani ments during the evening were played by Mis 3 Hneston r Mr« J. Simmonds, Mis* Baker, and Miss D Stabb. A marked feature of the eveniug's en terfainm°nt was the violin music provided by Miss and Slaater Reason, which would be really hard i.o beat*. At the close of the concert a most enjoyable dance-was engaged in by those present. Mr Carroll officiated as M.0., the music being supplied by the youthful violinists men tioned above, occasionally relieved by Miss Baker and Air G. Simmonds (piano) 'J he thanks of ""tbe committee ar« due to their secretary, Mr J. C. Smith, who successfully executed the many duties that fell to his slme. Mining.— This industry is still firm m the grip of King Eio-t's iron paw, and tbe followers of this occupation are, with very few exceptions, suffering from the effects of a long-continued idle ness which they enn ill afford. There are hopes, however, that the next summer will be a very favourable one for miners all over Central Otago, as owing to the heavy dtifts of snow in the ranges a splendid watftr supply can confidently be ex pected. A good nurnher of men are trying thsir luck at the river, beach combing, but two penny weights a day seems to be looked upon a» a big wage, and nine-tentbs of the men I am acquainted with are barely averaging one pennywtight per day. ' Rent Agitation at Ophir. — I observe by an advertisement in the Dunatan Times that the Ophir farmers are calling a meeting with the ob ject of app.oachiog the Government with a view of gating a remission of rents owing to the seveiity-of the winter. Sare'y the farmers must, as a body, be more alive to their own interests than other toilers, otherwise how do we hear so mucjkrof appeals to the Government for reduction of rent.advancestosettlers, revaluation bills, etc. ? &<n it be that those who clamour most for help are the b.- st looked after? How would the miners of Central Otago fare (mauy of whom would be glad of a small holding where they could put in some of the winter months that they aref-ozen out from their claims) if tbey ro'o as one man and demanded a remission of their rents, also free miner's lights for a year ? Or why should not the hundreds of our population who depend for a crust on rabbiting during the winter""montbs aek the same paternal Government for some compen sation ?— for none have suffered more from the severity of the weather thuu thny. \Vhy the farmers are more entitled to consideration than ythe others I have mentioned is a problem, beyond my mediocre comprehension to solve, particularly applied to Central Otago, where chaff is sought for at the present time at £5 10s per ton on the ground.

307,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,234,An Incident of the Crimean War.,"One day the Russians send a. message to the English trenches during a flag of truce. ""Your 58-pouuder gun,"" says the bearer, "" that your people call Jenny, is a beautiful gun, but we think we have one as good in that embrasure, and we should like to have a fair duel with her."" The challenge is accepted, and everything is arranged for 12 o'clock next day. When the time arrived, all the batteries ceased flciug, and the armies looked on. Our sailors' gun detachment mounted on their parapet and tcok off their hats, saluting the Ilussiaaß. The Rusmnj returned the compli ment. The English gun was given the first shot as tha senior gun ; it struck the side of the embrasure. Thtn they flred — a very good shot, too. The third shot from Jenny weut clean through the Russian embrasure, and up went two gabior.s. The bluejackets Jumped up on theic parapet aud cheered, thinking they had beaten their opponent. Not a bit ! A minute afterwards down went the gabions, aud out came the Russian gun again. Several more shots were fired from both sides, all very good ones. Jenny got a nasty thump, but it did her uo harm. At length — I think the seventh shot from our side — we law the Russian gun clean knocked over. Our fellowi cheered vociferously, and the Russians mounted their parapet and took off their hats in acknowledgment of their defeat. All the batteries then opened again. Thus ended the great duel. — "" The Crimean War,"" by Sir Daniel Lyaons.",0,-1.829780584,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
245,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,172,MR FREDERIC VILLIERS AT THE PRINCESS THEATRE.,"FIRST LECTURE. There was a large attendance at the Princes^ Theatre on Tuesday night to see and to hear the "" heroof nine campaigns,"" Mr Frederic Villiers, who, after representing his papers in the late war between China and Japan, has, according to the argent request of that enterprising caterer for the public entertainment, Mr R. S. Smythe, come direct from the scene of that international struggle to the colonies — taking steamer at Yokohama for Vancouver, and thence to Sydney — to enlighten tho inhabitants of this part of the world as to some of the stirring experiences which he has had, and as to some of tha fighting which he has witneesed — and though ""yet young, he has,"" to quote Archi bald Forbes, "" seen fighting euough to consti tute him a veteran twice over."" Mr Villiers appeared on the stage not in the oithodox dress of the lecturer, for the reason tbat such a drees would be inappropriate to the subject of his lecture. He appeared instead in his campaign ing dress, over which he was glad, owing to the draughtiness of the theatre, to assume an overcoat before he was half through with his subject. He speaks entirely without note, in choice language, and in an easy and generally conversational style, without straining after elocutionary effect. When he did forsake his conversational manner, as was the case in his realistic description of the great battle around Plevna in the Russo-Turkish war, the rapidity of his delivery somewhat mirred the effectiveness of what was undoubtedly a fine example of word - painting. There was a judicious contrasting of light and shade throughout tile entire lecture, *nd the humorous sidelights which he cast upon a grim series of pictures were very happily executed. Mr Villiers introduced his lecture by explaining briefly, and illustrating with slides thrown upon the screen, the mysteries attendant upon the preparation of the war artist's sketches for reproduction in the papers, and then, after modestly but unnecessarily apologising for his inability to keep bimeelf out of a lecture wV-ich had his experiences for its subject, he took his audience with him to the scene of the Russo- Turkish war, exhibiting to them many sketches depicting events which occurred in that exciting campaign. A graphic account of the fighting around Plevna was followed by what was the most thrilling feature of the lecture — a vivid and touch ing description of the terrible march of the fever stricken, spirit-broken Turkish prisoners from captivated Plevna, dragging their way through Roumania, in the severest winter that country had seen for yeara, to their captivity in Russia, the grim procession followed by clouds of carrion crows hovering about to contend with ravenous dogs for the bodies of the weak among the ragged throng who, unable to continue tha jouney, would throw themselves from the ranks to die in tke snow which lay thick on the ground. From this terrible scene it wai a wel come change to bright Egypt, whn-e, on board the gunboat Condor, under Lord Charles Beresford— to whern a warm tribute of admira tion was paid— Mr Villiers was present on the occasion of the bombardment of Alexandria. Of the audacious and successful attack of the fott Marabout by that gunboat, which was supposed toacfasa sort of non-combatant 'handmaiden to the other vessels of the British fleet, was pre sented a glowing and graphic description which evoked cordial applause ; and then Mr Villiers passed on to speak of his experiences with the Japanese at the front. Ho did not, however, carry his narrative of this late campaign beyond (he fall of Pingyang, reserving for a subsequent lecture his description of the capture and massacre of Port Arthur. Incidentally to this portion of the lecture, Mr Viliiers testified that the Japanese army was as will cqupped &<h any Continental army, and that its commis sariat and ambulance oorps could not very well be bettered. He also bore testimony to the honest attempts of the Japanese to latterly carry out the warfare ou the humane Hues practised by European countries, but confirmed the reports tbat at tho commencement of the war the Chinese struggling in the water from the sunken vessel Kow Sbing were shot down in large numbers by their adversaries. For the methods of the Chinese in the field Mr Villiers professed no admiiabion. On the contrary, he says that "" He who fights and runs away, lives to run another day "" is their interpretation of an old adagp. Tbe latter part of the lecture was amnsiugly illustrated by sketches taken during the war by a Japanese artidt. In theeo sketches the Cuiaeae were invariably represented as running away, and that was • the enly thing about them that was authentic. One of these grotesque sketches was so heavily scored by black lines as obviously to require some explanation, and the explanation wav distinctly droll. Mr Villiera remarked that in the da>s when smokeless powder becomes universal the war artist will ba placed in a trying position because at present he introduces clouds of smoke into his sketches to indicate action. The Japanese artist, however, has improved upon the methods employed by his European colleagues, for the heavy black lines in this sketch were actually intended to show the course of tbe bullets ! The subject of Mr Villiers's eecond lecture, delivered on Wednesday night, was "" Battles, Bivouacs, and Banquets,"" and the concluding portion of the lecture was devoted to the, takiDg of Port Arthur.",0,-1.834143766,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

207,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,134,TALK OF THE DAY.,"*** The last Gaming Act makes a reduction in the number of raca meetings at which the totalisator can be ÜBed. The conference of No vember last drew up a schedule of 133 meetings for. the season, and in that list Otago is entitled to 32 meetings, as follows : Al*xaudra, Beau mont, Cromwell, Duutroou, Kurow, Lake County, Lumsden, Manio oto, Otago Hunt Club, Palmerston, Riverton, Roxburgh, St. Bkthaus, Southland, Tapanui, Tuapeka, Vin cent, Wiilmea Pinion, Wairio, Wiuton, Wynd ham, and Wnikouaiti, one meeting e^ch ; Gore, North Otago, and the Taicri, t*o each ; and the D J.C. four meetings. *** A fortnight ago we were coneidiring the statistics of the racing season that ended on the 31*t olt. If my readers will bear with me, and not r»ise the cry that th|y are getting too much old-f«gey Bluff, I will ask their attention to seme records of the turf dating back nearly 20 jenre. The earliest complete set of ntntistios in my possession relate to the racing year 1876 77. In that f etson lha added money came to a total of £25,468, or just about tho fourth of the sum that was disbursed in the season just closed. OUgo was well to tlia front in those days, 36 meetings having been held south of the Waitaki, to which £8723 waa given iv added money, while Canterbury was a poor second with 21 meetings and £4981 added nicney. For present purposes I do not intend to continue that comparison of figures. Such a task may be reserved for anothe r arfc ; cle, to be written — or rather finished, for I have already started it — when leUure permits. My immediate ob ject is to call attention to a few of the best per formers as they cropped up year by year in that now remote period, and show what they earned. We often speak of the ""good old times,"" in a tone implying that money was easily earned on the turf in those days. This is a fallacy. There are .greater possibilities nowadays, for race horses as well as men, than in the times gone by. Let us put this statement to the proof, i In the season named, 1876-77, the six leading winntrs were — 6nyFawkes,s ...£1425 Bribery, 3 ... £620 Fwhhook, 4 ... 1206 Dauebury, 3 ... 675 Tommy Dodd a ... 780 Ariel, 4 ... 470 Note here that the top fellow in that far-off season— glorious, hand»»me, and hardy Guy Fa wises — earned within £9 of the horse that heads th« list for the past year ; but the accu mulated earnings of Guy and bis five mates above enumerated came to only £5076,. while the half d^z«n who lop the poll for 1894-95 raked in £7614. There i» not a great deal of differ ence iv that comparison ; but here is another of f»r more ftignific&ut import — namely, that in 1876-77 only 33 horses are named in the list of winners of £200 and over, while for the period jusb concluded there are — how many, do you think ? — One hundred and five. There is no need to presa the argument any further. Enough has been shown to prove that racing is not goiwg to the dickens. Let us go back to our records of horses. In 1877-78 the leading six were — Templelon, a ... £1510 Lara, 5 £868 Ariel, 5 1236 Mata, 3 765 Trump Card, 3... 1142 Danebury, 4 ... 640 Templafcou had in that year won bis second Dun edin Cup with 9 3, beating his stable companion 7.3, while Ariel, who for winning the Canter bury Cup had been apportioned t>p weight of 97, fiui>hed third, It was at that meeting also that Tompleton covered himself w'th glory by winning the D J.C. Handicip, thtn a mile and tbreo-quarter race, with 10.0. It was a great weight for a little horse, but old Bob Rny in the saddle was worth at least half a stone in weight. He was a wonderful ridw, | aid on that day he rode at hi b best. I can see the xt.c* quite plainly as I write. Temple ton waited on Ariel till reaching the quarter-mile post, and then he made the greatest) tffort of I bis lifa ond won. Trump Card won three Derbys that season — at Christchureb, Welling tou, and Dunedin; Lara annexed the Auck land Cup ; Maia's solitary win was in the C.J.C. Handicap ; and Danebury owect his position in the list to a ran of luck at country meetings. In 1878 79 the six bosses were Maritana, a ...£2415 Mafa, 4 ... .£lOlO Pinfire, 4 1385 Fishhook, 6 ... SJB The Agent, 5 ... 1330 Nemo, 3 704 The ex-hack Maritana had in that season rtiaked the C.J.C. Handicap, for which she wss weighted at 7.7 and ridden by Jimmy Wattie. A rare good mare she was, too, | tk»URh it took everybody a long time to make ' up ber pedigree, and she had really risen 'from the ranks, having at one time, it is said, car | >ied a butcher's basket. In this season she won 10 rsces out of 18 starts. Pinfire, who helped Mat* to bring their sire Dead Shot into prominence, ran very consistently, scoring 12 firsts and beir-g only onca unplaced, while The Agent started 27 titnei and won 15 races. Ntrao was a particularly good co'.t, and it was a bundled pibitts th*t he died before maturity. He was regarded as the comiog champion. In 1879-80 we find four of Traducer's stock ia the leading half^lczen — Betrayer, 3 ... £15<i5 Foul Play, 5 ...£958 Mata, 5 1107 Soukar, 5 887 Chancellor, 5 ... 1020 Grey Momus, a ... 770 Betrayer, riddsn by Fuller, started at level money for the Derby in a field of eight, but he was too 6mall to carry the weight, and after chasing Hornby and Grip and finding that he could not get up, he eased off iv the straight and fiuished fifth, behind Hornby 1, Grip 2, Billingsgate 3, and On Dit 4-. But the lighter weights of the Canterbury Cup suited Betrayer, and bis, exceptional staying quality was also of service, the result being that he achieved a brilliant victory over Ray's p»ir, Hornby and Templeton. Of tbe pair Hornby lasted the longest, but Bttrajer lioked him by three quarters of a length. Three-year-olds bad a bit j more pull then at weight for age than they have I now. They curried 7.1 in the Canterbury Cup, while aged ho»e3 (Templeton was one) had 9.9. Betrayer won only two more races thafc season — the Wangwiui Cup (£IOOO that year) and the I South Canterbury Cup. By the time the I Wanganui race came on he wai carrying Mr Stead's colours. He beat Hornby by a head j after a capital finittb, the latter conceding 21b. | MaU's wins that season included the Dunedin Cup and the Flying Stakes at Chrietchurch, in which he had his great set-ta with Le Loup ; Chancellor* six wins included the C.J.C. Han dicap ; Foul Play collared the Wellington Cup and other events ; Soukar placed to his credit the Napier Handicap ; and Grey Momus, who started 31 times, secured 13 wins. Come we now to the 1880-81 season, in which we find the list headed by LeLoup,6 ...£1565 Foul Play, 6 ...£lll3 RandwicTc, 5 ... 1302 Natator, 5 ... 1048 SirModred, 3 ... 1294 SlrGoorge,3 ..... 1015 It ia a pingular coincidence that Le Loup's win ning* are i-xaotly the same as those of Betrayer in the previous season. But Le Loup did not have to graft so hard. He collared all his money at the one meeting, the C J.C. Spring fixture, whereat he walked off with the leading tresb'e His only other race that eeasan was in the St. Andrew's Handicap, at Dunedin, where, carrying 9.12, he suffeiv.d dsfeat by Atlantic 6 10. Randwick, running for Dick Mason, won 13 races out of 24 starts, these including the Forbury Handicap, Wangauui Stakes, aud Nupior Handicap. Sir Modred made good his claim to high rank by wioniog the Dctby, in which Virginia Water and Badsworth followed him home. They were a bad lot taut year, bub Sir Modred could do no more than win. He also beat a particularly poor fl.ild in the Dun edin Cup ; but it was a moribonous perfor mance on his part to win the Tiroaru Cup, a mil« and Hurt e-quarters, with 8 10, giving Lady Emma 19 b The other three of our chosen six all won cups — Foul Pity at Auck land, Natator at Wellington, and Sir George at Waugnnui There were some fair horses racing in the 1881-82 season, and when the returns were made up we found the leaders to be Grip, 5 £1455 Claretc^, a ... £1020 Hippodamia, 3... 1155 Nonsense, 2 ... 023 Lady Emma, 4.,. 1820 Tasman, 3 ... 85 J Grip, the horse of one season only, made his mark in exactly the same way as Le Loup did in the previous ssason — viz., by appropriating the treble of C.J C. Handicap, Cantebury Cup, and Chrietchurch Plate, in which he was ridden by Derretb. Louis dOr finished second to him in tho Handicap and the Plate, but could not get a shop in the Cup. Hipp>jd»mia did a great season's work, having started in 28 race?, of which she won exactly half, including the Hawke's Bay Guineas and the T»ran*ki Cup, which then was a two-mile race at weight for age. It was at this meeting that Randwick was so unexpectedly defeated for the JC. Handicap by the light-weight Larry, who mn.de the pace from the jump and lasted long enough to win by half a lengkh. Lady Emma h*d four wins, the first of the series in the Hutt Park Haud<c»p, this being followed by the thrvefold aeccess at Dunedin — in the Cup wibh 7.6, in the J.C. Hindi c*p with 8.4, and in the Forbury Handicap with 8.12. Clarence's money was all won in jumping races, of w«ica he secured a dozen, and ran teoond in the Grand National when giving 381b to Kiterfelto, the winner. That smart filly Nonsense scored the possible, getting home in the four events for which she started, theoe including the Champagnes at Dnnedin and ChristcbuFch ; and Tasman gave some idea of his g&meness by winning eight of his 17 races and running second six times. Quality was exceptionally well re preteuted in the runner* of 1882-83, and no one will pretend to find a fluker in the following half doz«n — Welcome Jack, 3 £2521 King Quail, a ... £1056 Tasmau, 4 ... 1506 Mischief, 5 ... 970 Sir Modred, 5 ... 1076 Leonora, 3 ... 905 Here we have a real tap sawyer to head the poll, it being beyond question that Welcome Jack was a worthy champion of kis time. He won th*t year nine rtces oat of 14 starts, his prin cipal victories baing in the C.J.O Handicap, the Auckland Cup, and the Great Autumn Handi cap. In the latter racu he had 874 to carry, or only lib less than Tasman, who was a year older. A capital finish was fought out all along the rails between this pair, Lady EU»m», and Salvage, and inside the distance it looked as if the four might make a dead heat ef it, bnhin the last 25 yards Charley Rudings g*ve Welcome Jack a touch vrith the spur, and he shot out for a decisive win by nearly a length. T»snna picked up a dozen second-sized fetikee, wherein, however, he was generally meet ing good horses. Sir Modred landed the Canterbury Cup and three other races at the C.J.C. meeting — pretty nearly a record, I should s*y; King Quad secured the Wan g&nui Cup among other races, aud broke down t-hurtly afterwards ; Mischief captured the Wftlliagton Cap and Napier Handicap ; and Leonora nicked the Easter Handicap at Auck land besides other events. Can*rd was close up in seventh position that season, and Ada mant came next, his Duuedin Cup win placing htm 89 high on the list. Talking abjufc Ada mant, it may not be generally known that when he was training for th* Cup he had a very sus picious leg. Thcvy v.i'M :vft-aid that a tendon would go, and iv order to ease him as much as p^siibie he was alternately swum and galloped. That wan the kiud of training ox which he won tiie Dunedin Cup. His success was not, how ever, such a surprise to his parky as to the crowd. He ran a really goad trial — to g«od that one man who saw ifc thought it gcod enough to s&onre a couple of hundreds straight out. At this sttvge I call a hald, promising to renew the subject and bring it up to da'.e before the racing season is far Advanced. * # * The principal events of the Ascat meet ing held in June are reported under rhe regular heading in this week's irsue. Concerning the two-mile handicap oa the first day we le&rn that not a bet of any kind was traceable to this affair before the numbers wore hoisted, but as soon as it was seen that Captain Machell bad decided to depend upon Ravensbury alone, Ibis horse was made a good favourite. And whit is meant by tha term ""a good favourite"" is shown iv the report. Ravensbury opened at 2 to lin a field of ninß ; and he won very easily at the fiuish. If such a set of circumstances came before us in New Zealand we should to a man ""slate"" the handicapper. In England they seldom do that ; it is, indeed, «r?ite un common to see a handicap seriously criticised in print. This L»s its advantage?, d.ubtless, but a handicapper worth his salt would, I should say, sooner work under a system by which, while awarded blame when he de served it, hie got praised when praise was warranted. But I am digressing. We were talking of the Ascot races, and to return I note thafc R»vensbury has established a record with respect to tha weight carried by the winner of the •• Stakes,"" the nearest approach to the 9.9 of Captain Machcit's horse beiog the 9.0 carried by the six year-old Rosicruciaa in 1871, when there were 16 runners. Musket won this race in 1869, when, at a three-year-old, he was ridden by Chaloner at 8.12. Ravensbury's time, 3min 37sec, stands ai the best re cord since Ishmael won (1883) in 3min 34sec. Persimmon, winner of the Coventry Stake*, is own brother to Florizel 11, and both were bred by their present owner, the Prince of Wales. Persimmon was making his first public appear ance in this race. He is a good colt and reckoned to ba a likely candidate for next year's Derby. If he stays as wsll a* his elder brother he will.ba go id enough — Florizel II cmi ap parently geb any distance. He sins ply played with his opponents in the last furlong of the Gold Vase. Backers had no difficulty either in finding the winner of the Prince of Wales's Stakes ; and if the actual favourite for the Roysl Hunt Cvp — Red Heart — made a poor show, the ttake did not go to an outsider, the winner being the four-year-old Clorane, for whom Mr Basset g&ve 1300gs after his success in the Cork Derby. More than Cloranc'a weight (8.11) has only once been carried by a Royal Hunt Cup wiuuer— viz., by the erratic Peter, who, as a five-year-old, won under 9.3 in 1881. In the Coronation Stakes the Ouo Thousand and Oaks wiuueru found their penalties too much of a burden, and the well-performed Matchmaker was put down owing to a similar cause in the St James's Palace Stakes, but in the Ne^ Stakes punters had a turn by the success of Roquebrune, a daughter of St. Mar guerite, for whom Sir J. Miller gave 4100gs as as a yearling. *#* The Gold Cup race deserves a paragraph to itself, seeiDg that it is descriptive of another victory for that phenomenally - groat horse Isioglasa, who had been specialty trained for this particular race, while it was generally under stood that, win or lose, it was to be his lash appearance on any course— a report, by the way, which the Sportsman* special commis sioner discredits, saying: ""Whether Isinglass will run again or n:t I do not know, nor indeed does his trainer ; but I should think that it is reasonablo odds he will continue to scoop the pool till the end of the present season."" Wo th»U have to wait to see whether the son of Deadlock races again. But in the meantime there is enough before us to establish bis claim to the championship of England. In the Gold Cup, we are informed, he began as lazily as ever, and had to be woke up six furlongs from horn?, and for a moment coming into the straight it looked as though Reminder might b«at him for speed, but he soon put the issue beyond doabfc, and striding. along at hn leicura won in a oanter in very, slow time. And his record taken as a whole ii quite first class. Up to and iucluding the Cup he has wou 11 of his 12 races, and iv all he has credited Mr H. M'Cahnanfc with the exceedingly substantial sum of £57,455 in stakes, made up as follows : As a two-yesr-old ho won £4577, as a three £18,860, as a four £31,493, and as * five £2520, the value of the A»cot Cup. He thus stand* well clear of Donovan, who had previously held the record with £55,154 10s. His only defeat was iv the Lanoaohire Pluto, when attempting to give Raeburn 101b. *a* A writer iv the Australasian contributes the following story : — A singularly glaiing case with a steeplechaser has been told me by a racing authority, who was a witueis of the inoident. It was an up-country steeplechase, for which there were three starters — one a hot favourite, while the second had a chance, and tbe third waa almost a certainty — to f»U. It did fall at the second fence, bub immediately afterwards, to the ditnuay of the populace, the favourite ran off the coarse and Wlfcsd ittto tha bush. As there was only one horse left in the race then, it setmod a good thing for him, and tho layers were dslighttd— but the videt of thab partieolai horse was not. Ik had been so much like pick ing up money to baok the favourite that he wai on with the rest of tho crowd. Ho hesitatad for an instant only, theu galloped off into tho bush after the horse, and helped to bi iug him back on to the course. After tbat the favourite k«pb the coucae, faithfully followed by the rescuing party, whose action it was generally agreed was humane, sportsmanlike, ond com mendable. This is ja»% whore a Glcand National Steeplechase at Fletbiogtou snffrr* by oo'bi par 13011. Should & horse fall, th>» others with brutal indiffertnco continue the course, and do not wail for the afflicted animal to be caught and n mounted. *** A New York man sends to the Field a dtamal picture of racing as it is carried on in his State under the new arrangements. Last fall, he ssvYß, a bill was passed by the Senate, emanating from the Mawworms a-jd Methodists of New York, prohibiti»g bettitg, and so strin gent are its enactments, and so imperative are the orders to the m.^tmidons of the law to see that it is effectively obeyed, that at the open ing of the legitimate racing season ab Brooklyn Park both backers and bookmakers were dum founded. A panic endued, and unless some raeaus are devised to drive a cosc'a and homes through this Rgressive act, as far as racing in the United Stales is concerned its death knell is Rounded. True, on the day of the Brooklyn Haudicap some attempt was m%do to bet ia dafiance of the notices put-up, bub it was un available. Pinker ton's men intervened, and on the following day the Jockey Club issued a mandate thvt, if illegal betting again took place wibbiu'the Brooklyn Park inc<o«ure, the execu tive would be held responsible for the breach of"" of the law. Further, in the morning, before racing commenced, Mr Pinkerton himself, mounting a chair, delivered an orattoo, stating thab he and his merry men were employed, by the Brooklyn authorities to see that no money passed hands; that if it did so the parties would be arrested, and probably subjected to imprisonment. The ro*utt was that instead of the hubbub and excitement of betting, the halloaiag out of tbe adds, and the mad rush to get on favourites, all around was hashed and still. The scene was unique, and reminded ono rather of fuHoral obsequies than the orgie of racing. Betting was allowed ""on the nod"" amongst the big bugs, bu.fr the smaller fry were ruthlessly shut *uk in the cold shade of d«sola tioa. No wonder, therefore, that the attendance was meagre, and unless something be deviled to resuscitate the old state of affaire, rasing in N«w York is doomed to extinction. It seams hard that the rich should be allowed to gamble and settle elsewhere, whilst the ready-money punter and bookmaker are suppressed, and walk about with their hands in their pockets, looking «s dejected and miserable as it is pos sible for human beings to look. The big bags, tho shoddy wealthy upper ten, may bet on credit, whilst the crowd can only look on, ima gine they have fancies, and in a pecuniary sense remain quiescent. *** We manage things better than that in New Zealand ; and can also show Australia how to conduct racing decently and give the crowd a show to participate in tho national sporb. And the reason, pure and simple, is that; we have the totalisator, the Great Regulator of the turf. We have seen above how the mob are shut out in America. Let me quote &n old Australian on the subject of racing in that country. He hae a short story to tell. It runs in this wiae : — I live close to a racing track in New South Wales and often go over when there is a meeting on. I always go among the oat* side crowd, and now and then have a mild flutter with a few bob. That Is when I fancy a favourite. I never back an outsider. The layers don't reckon to pay when outsiders g«b home. Such an event is regarded as lawful bunce. How is ib worked ? I'll tell you. I saw it done one d*y. A stranger went to ana o| the bookies and asked him what prioe Biases. That wasn't tbe name, but it will do. Moses. (* rom&utic title again) replied thu.t the prw3 was 10 to 1. The inquirer took £1 worth at that odds and received a card inscribed to fcho effect that he was standing £11 to nothing. Ho ■ bad paid bis quid. Blazes won, and the baolaa"" went to collect. "" Don'fc know yer,"" w*s tfcm reception he met with. "" But I know you,"" came the answer, "" and hero'o your- card."" TUa backer, being ordered away, b«gan to cut up rough, whereupon a hulking lout standing about 6ft 4in sidled up to him and said, "" He don't owe yer nobhink, mate."" •• But he doee,"" replied the, hacker. Without further ceremony the bully fetched the backer one-two straight be tween the eyes, and when the' latter attempted to rise he was atked again, ""-Ho don't owe yer nothink, dbea he ? "" And the poor fellow, Eeeing no sign of assistance from the bystanders, who apparently were accustomed 111 1 such scenes, made a feeble reply in the negative, walking off with his tail between his legs. Such was the story told me when I visited Sjdney a couple of years ago, and from the samples of ruffUns I saw •myself at one of the suburban meetings which I attended I can believe it to ba true. And yet the people over there teem half frightened of the totalisator. **•* Ab one of the spring meetings at Cban- HUy, Dick Figes, the starter to the French Hockey Club, bad despatched the runners for the last race — there were three starters-r-aud promptly jumped into his trap, which was. wait ing, near the star tin g-pos-t, and hurried off to the station, in order to catch his train home to Le Vosinet. He had almost reached the rail way station, when he oalled out to a Johnny, _who had seen the finish, and asked wb&b had ,won. "" Dead heat ! "" waß the reply, and Dick hastily realised that the dead-heaters might be ■waiting at the post for bim to start them in the run- off. So helter-skelter back he posted, and just as he gut there a friend called out, '•What ate you coming back for, Figes P R*cing is .all over."" "" Why, there's a dead heat for the last race, isn't there ? "" exclaimed the starter. "" Dead heat be hanged ! D'Ed Etc yon the race, old man ! "" And it was so. *#f Once on a time it was quite customary ODt the appearance of a handicap to find an owner affecting indignation and scratching hit borsfr straightway. Importance was,- 1 think, attached to tho moral effect produced ; in other words, the disaffected owner was not always so utterly disgusted as- he pretended to bs, but desired in his own clumsy way to bring pre« •ure to bear on the baodicapper in view of com ing events. Saeb, at anyrate, was the case sometimes, though in a few instances it may-bo laeucved that the precipitate action wrs the out come erf honest discontent. We read and hear very little of these lightning seratohings nowa days. Perhaps the handicapping has improved ; perhaps- owners' are leas positive about tbe ( correctness of their first judgments ; perhaps, it may be- that stakes are valuable enough to be '■worth muEing without waiting ; possibly all three influences are at work. Whether or no, the fact is as stated. The latest illustration to hand is in connection with the New Zealand ,Cup. It was on the whole, 1 believe, a good handicap that Mr Hemy prf pared, yet not fault less — the absolutely perfect handicap has never ibeen made- by mortal man — and still, though before us for some weeks, nary a one dropped out,, and the malcontents when the first accep tance was payable came only to seven, of whom three are out'of the country and one (Lottie) has gone amiss. This result is highly satisfac tory, and Mr Henry may be congratulated. Something may be allowed, for the custom of immediate scraichings having become un .laehionable, but after giving this consideration due weight there is a residuum of fact which (betokens a capital series of calculations on the •weight-a^jtistcr'sr pait. The percentage of .in, I think, a record. Forty-nine .have accepted for the Cup, and nine haye 1 popped out— namely, Pounamn, Lottie, Bonuie Scotland, Golden Plover, Spindrift, Osculaior, «nd Bnoklot. Of these, Lottie and Spindrift 'are tbe only two that have been at all backed ""by the public, and those not for much. Last '.year there wer» 51 acceptors) and 19 went out on the firet acceptance; iv 1893 Ihe correspon ing figures were 45 aud 26 ; while for 1892 the acceptor* numbered 45, in 1891 they wero 44, irr 1890 the total was 38, and in 1869 it was 37. *** I have very little to add yet awhile by way of advice to back era. The six I originally named as well treated — Prime Warden, North Atlaiitio, Skirmisher, Mahaki, Lottie, and Magazine — lose one of their number, Jim Ke&n haviDg taken his mare out; but I do not desire to select anything in her place, though if pressed to do io I should' probably pick on Pegasus. There are disquieting rumours afloat regarding both North Atlantic and Mahaki, but I know of nothing definite that can be quoted to their* detriment. The most>impor tant feature of the -acceptance 1 list, to my < mind, is the retention therein of three horsey belong ing to Mr GolUn. Tbe- fact is' already inter preted ai further evidence that the Hawke's Bay owner really intends to be represented, and ihe prevailing- opinion seems to be-that Stern chaser is the likeliest of bis lot. As regards the Derby and Oaks, the following figures show the result of* the' progress payment- as corn fated with previous years :—: — '91 '92 '93. '94 ■OS Derby ... 21 21 20 24 13 Oaks- 17 ID 12 15 9 The presence^ Mannlicherc no donbt has had something to do- with, shortening the list of acoeptois in' the Derby, but I do not see any thing of superior calibre in tb«> O<ak3 lob. It will be seen that the nine Oaks Miics. represent eight different owners, arid as all seem to-bxve Bomo sort of a show, there may be an interest ing race. • *""** Reginald,"" in the Melbourne Sportsman, disonsses the- chance* of the V.R.C. Derby of 1895 : — Taking the most noticeable as they sppe«r on the' list before me, he fays, the first worthy of attention is Fortunio. This near relation to the flying Fortunatua has more than once exhibited remarkable dash in public, and, *8 he is a nioely- shaped, lengthy colt, it might be sb well not to allow him to slip our memories cext season. Meesr* Bailey and Orr'a pair, Onward snd Chit Chat, though well bred enough for anything, bave not, so far, done anything that entitles them to much respect. But Trentham, one of tbe St. Albans lot, is a youngster from whom something good may be expected. True, the half-brother to Lochiel snd Steadfast has not, up to date, shown any form under »ilk, but in his defence it can bo Eaid that fee has never yet been teen at his best in point of condition. When Trentham has. been got into proper fix I've an idea he will uphold the reputation of his family: In. bis two-year-old essays Redcourt, another of Mr W. R. Wilson'p, has scarcely been successful enough to encourage recom mendation here. v About the next pair, how ever, there is a far~ different tale to tell. The j couple alluded to are Wallace and Challenger, and both have very solid claims to favourable ! consideration in connection with next Novem ber* battle for the Blue Riband. Of the two I- preft r Wallace, who appears to be the more even-ttmper d, and has tkeady shown uncom mon ability over a mile. Challenger i?, un doubtedly, a dandy, but is orjeof the eager sort,, which are more famed for 6prin&ng than staying, and, all things considered, it might be safer to rely 00 Wallace befope - his big stable companion, unquestionably brilliant though ■ the latter is. Eallara's form hardly, approaches Derby standard, nor ba3 Cartridge acted up to what might reasonably be expected from ope of his parentage. But Car tridge may yet furnish into a colt of high class, fie is bred to both gallop and aiaj, Horse' of. the century, Carbine, 6ired him, and he is from St. Albana'a daughter, St. Odille, who could go as fast as she liked. A really well-proportioned col 6is The Meiry Boy, and as Mr S. G Cook is in the habit of swooping down in the spring with a good three-year-old, it would not alto- Ke'herbo wise, despite his moderate two-year old di""playg, to quite overlook the son of Tren ton and Mara St. David, in point of look?, is from top to toB a Derby colt, but his deeds have not been in keeping with his ""swellish"" appearance. *** Tho records of racing at Cromwell which were printed in these columns a fortnight ago have interested a large circle of readers, and in expressing thtir thanks some of them mention several matters which deserve to be placed on the record. One is that the once medium weight rider Foote, whose name figures so pro minently at the first and second meetings, is identical with the pvesant popular station master at Pelichet Bay. Mr Francis Foote, whom I have (he pleasure of knowing person ally, is, with Mr. G. F. Richardson (ex-Minister for Lands) aud. others who might be mentioned, a living contradiction of the saying that a man who begins with horses winds up by go ; ng to the dogs. Hl3 contention with racing came ab ut, however, rather by force of circum stances than cf di-iiberate search. He was in those days the agent for Cobb and Co. at I Clyde-, and in that capacity had a lot to do with horses, while i\n ability in the saddle was often demonstrated in other ways than race riding. One of the winners he rode at the 1869 meetirjg was Roderick, in the Miners' Purse, and it' is related tbat Duhig, who rode his own horse and was following up closely in the straight, plied his whip over the- body of yoang Foote. The latter *tiood his punishment and got horns, and then had the satisfaction of sseing Dulrig disqualified for the resb of the meetiog. It was on the same day* jn tbe Ladies' Purse won by Madam, owned by Mr Dagg (the wrestler), thatCftpt&in Jackson B u-ry performed his much-viuntsd feat of "" riding two horses in the one race, carrying part of th-: cwrfeon his back, and coming in s cond."" Tfta redoubtable romancist weighed out on LiMe Nell, was I thrown io the race, and, citcbing hold of a bystander's horse, he cut across the coarse with it, smoth; red in mud, and csme in second ; bat of course he was r.ou in the race In the Hurdle R&ce won by Poison, in 1869, Harry Goodman rode Pasha, wbo fell at the last fence and broke hia neck, while two of the three placed horse? galloped over Goodman's head as 'he was partially fitting up. I learn also that the Mr Limbr>ck who owned Traveller is identical with the Joseph Limbrick who now acts as gardener for Mr Hall at Mataura and was called as a witness in the trial of Minnie Dean. **.* Some agreement ought to bs come to as to the use of the title "" Graud National."""" We have two claimants in New Zealand, there are two in Victoria, and several others about the colonies. The last of which we have a repirb is the one at Ca,u>field, where the Hurdle Race was run last Saturday. It is- a rece forbOOaovs, of two miles and a-qua*fcer. E-nmalea, who was honoured with the crushing impost (for- a little mare) of 12.9, did not acc-p!;, but Bremer had two left in r Bill 11 6 and Ro*es!eai 11.7, and one of these; Rosestem, proved to be the winuer.

It is pointed out that the effects of reductions recently made have not yet been fully felt," and it is anticipated that a further reduction of £7000 will be made during the ensuing year. Duriug the season. 1894-95 only £934 was expended in improve ments; and the recent reduction in stakes was due to """" the unprecedented bad luck of tbe Cup meeting of 1892", and the Autumn meeting of 1893, during which meetings there were six wet days out of eight days' racing, causing a shortage of at least £12,"000 """" The improve ments to the course include the eieotionoi 10 of Pol&in's-starting gates", new water service, gate s, committee's' stand, and other works. The main tenance account includes the eo»t of 200 new hurdles, repairs to buiklings; and the supply of s*B loads of tan, 238 of ashes, 200 of soil, and 400 of loam. The figures show that the last Melbourne Cup meeting returned a profit; of £7950 after paying £14,140 in stakes. The profits accruing from the Grand Nations I meeting of 1894 was £1117. The New Year's Day meeting of 1895 resulted in a credit balance of only £395, and the profit on the last Autumn meeting was bat £44. The Q'leeu's Birthday meeting resulted in a- profit of £326.

Defendant : Oh yes, you may rely upon me. His Worship: If you don't pay you will have to go gaol.

He then gavo a graphic description of the row, which was partly caased through the youth Smith, who took iff his coat to fight. The fight took place, was brief, but sanguinary. John Harding, a shipwright, deposed that he was of the opposition, but a passive spec !ator. He had seen a good many rights in his time, but never, since he was at Donny brook fair in his early days, had he witnessed such ageneial row, six pairs were bammeriDg each other at one time, and the rattle of bones and noses was enough to make night hfdious He could only describe it as an awful conflict; the blood was falling from Smith's nose.

225,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,152,THE DUNEDIN FANCIER'S CLUB.,"The annual show in connection with the Dunedin Fanciers' Club was open again on Saturday and well patronised, the Garrison Hall in the evening being thronged with people Mr J. F. Roberta's "" Simplex "" incubator w«s in full work, and Urge numbers of strong, healthy chickens were hatched out by its aid. The process was watched with much interest. About 9 o'clock Mr MTEns, one of the vice presidents, addressing those present from the stage, said he had to tbank them for their attendance, and was pleased to be able to tell them that the show had been very successful. — (Applauser) As in years past they had had an art union in connection with the show, aud they might have seen that there were prizes advertised on the tiokets which had been cold. This had been the custom for years back, but unforbunately the police had advhed thorn almost at the last moment — wLich was probably not their fault, ag (liiy might not hive seen a ticktt till the last moment, but at the same time it was a pity it came so lists — that they were acting illegaily, and th%t.if the arfc union was continued and the prizes -presented they would be contravening the ac!;, and steps would be taken against them. He did not think those present wanted^o see them fined, or possibly get three or ""four months in gaol, but they would try all in their power to keep faith with the public. They had decided to postpone the drawing of the tickets till the 16th imt , which was they day on whioh they paid their prize money over. During the interval they would take steps to write to the Oolouial Secretary, and take legal advice in Dunedin, so that they would not be acting illegally, and he trutted that thsy would ba able to jjive the .public the things advertised, or some thing fully equivalent, without coutravei.ing the act. He dared to say that they had all confi dence in the society, and would bear with it in aa emergency of this kind. He again thanked them for their attendance. Next year probably the Champion show, whioh had already bsen -held in different centres, would be held here. They would then have an opportunity of seeing specimens in all the fancy olasses from various parts of New Zealand, judged by experts. MEETING OF FANCIEBS. During the afternoon a meeting of fanciers was held, at whioh there were about 30 gentle men present, and Mr Fbksuson, who occupied the cbair, explained that the object of the meeting was to consider the alterations in the rules of the New Zealand Poultry Assoc : ation concerning the medals to be given at the Ohsmj'ionship show. Mr Aitken was surprised at the alteration. He bad always been against affiliation, and he now more strongly disapproved of it than ever. He moved — "" That the meeting instruct the secretary to wiite the New Zealand Poultry Association protesting strongly against the pro posed alteration re medals at the next Cham pionship meeting."" Mr Williams seconded, and pointed out that several differeut kinds of birds were associated together to compete for a medal. The idea was monstrous. He also opposed the diet am of the association, that all pigeon fanciers had to buy rings from the association. Mr Rowan looked upon the association with rather a distrustful eye. He objeoted to the double entrance of birds entered for the Cham pionship prizes. Mr Hart (Lawrence) mentioned that an exhibitor in Lawrence had intended to compete at the late Championship meeting at Welling ton for Langshans, bat when he found that he had to show against Langsbaus and another kind of fowl he declined. Mr Pate n son's idea was that the Champion ship meeting should ba held in the four centres only, on the same terms as the shows were in Christchurch and Wellington. If the associa tion would not agree to this the society should withdraw altogether. The motion was carried unanimously. Mr Aitken moved — ""That unless the pre vious resolution be given effect to it a recommendation to the annual meeting of the Dunedin Fanciers' Club to withdraw from the association."" Mr Williams seconded this, and it was car ried unanimously. Mr Hart expressed a desire that the various shows might be arranged so that a week inter vened between each. Mr Fbew moved— ""That this meeting agree to tbe resolution of the New Zealand Poultry Association re rings, but that bafore such comes into effect 12 months' notice thereof should be given."" Mr Williams seconded, and the motion -was carried.",0,-1.881583531,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the close of the Wellington season Mr Leitch and his com* pany come on to Dunedin. *. 'Tbe Rev. Mr Haweis, who gives his lecture on Garibaldi on Thursday night, was in the midst of th-s stirring Italian Revolution of 1860. He was present at the siege of Capua, and wit nessed the triumphant entry of Garibaldi and King Victor Emanuel into Naples. He saw and knew personally most of the great men of the revolution, including Oavour, the King, G*ribaldi,- Pius, IX, Napoleon 111, and the chief Garibaldian generals, including Signor Crispi, cow Prime Minister of Italy.

Haweis has accepted tin invitation to visit Invercrgill, and en route will comply with a request to give' tiro closing lac tun s at Dunedin— oue on "" Garibaldi and the Italian Revolution of 1860,"" aud the other on ""Violin Makers and Violin Players."" Mr Haweit was present at Garibaldi's great cam paign, he atsistfd at the siege of Capua, and was conversant with all the great characters of the tevolution. He has been twice summoned to Rome to deliver his lectures on Garibaldi and Ms-zzioi, and he addressed crowded houses in tha •' Sala Dante "" there. For his lecture on Old Violinists at the Royal Institution, Lon don, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Emperor of Rusnia, and the owners of some of the finest violins in the world contributed to his loan col lection for the evening, and he has been a student and in his earlier days & practical votary of the violin, holding for three years the post of eolo violinist in the University of Cam bridge Orcheotral Society. The warm reception given to the G»ribaldi and Violin lectures in Aucklaud have influenced Mr Haweis in select ing them for repetition in Ducedin on the Bth and 9th of August respectively. * . * An amutiog story is told by the Era at the expense of Mr Daniel Bandroann (who threatens to return to the stage). Once, travel ling in the province?, he was needlessly uncivil *t rehearsal to an experienced actress who was to play the Widow Melnotle to hip Claude in tbe evening ; and she determined to be revenged. At Right he dashed upon the ■tage in the third act in his blue blouse and white trousers, a mass of enthu si*sm and broken Eoglisb, and cams in time to the famous Hue, "" Mother, I shall never be a paintec ? "" This was the old ladj'B opportunity , and she replied, sadly but firmly, and very, very audibly : "" No, my son ; nor an actor either ! "" The audience ro»red, and history declares that Bandmann was so upset that in tha following act he forgot, or feared to deliver, the celebrated ""Palace lifting to eternal summer "".speech. *. • Mr Beerbohm Tree proves how thoroughly the mere' matter' of physical disguise may be accomplished when he makes up for such a,. conventional patt as Captain Swift. Tree's own hair is auburn, and his face is modelled on severe, rugged, and fairly intellectual lines. As Ctpt&in Swift he puts on a dark, close-cropped wig that is exactly like the short-cut hair of the modern and metropolitan young man, we%rs a small mcuntache, and darkens bis brows, and when he has dene this, ao matter how intimate you may be with tho actor as an individual, or with his appearance in other parts, it is impossible to distinguish his personal characteristics. Moreover, his figure and movements are pure assumptions, so that a particular character known as Captbta Swift is before you, and Mr Beerbohm Tree, the actor, is never suggested. Yet this part is simply that of a young well-dressed, handsome man, the opportunities of disguise b«ing confined within the narrowest limits. Mr Tree always changes his complexion for the various characters he plays, a point not always observed by the most celebrated aotora. * . * The revival of the Napoleonic legend in France, England, and the United States has led Mr J. C. Williamson to consider whether he could not get Australia into the fashion as well. Since "" M»darxe Bans-Gene,"" ""The Royal Divorce,"" and other plays are proving so satisfactory in England, why not in Australia P Mr Williamson intends to make the trial, and has so far laid matters in train that on the conclusion of the Gaiety boom— if that event be not synonymous with the Greek Kalend*— Wills's play, "" The Royal Divorce,"" will be produoed at the Sydney Lyceum, Mr Fbil. Goatcher, states Table Talk, has the scenery in hand, and new people will be im ported for the leading parts. There are three good men to choose from for the character of Napoleon, Mr Murray Carson, who played the part in London ; Mr J. H. Clynde*, who ap peared in the provinces ; and our old friend Mr George C. Miln, who has been touring with the piece in Great Britain. Mr Miln has one advantage over the other two actors in his Strong personal resemblance to the famous Coraicau. '»• Hx August Manns is oi opinion that the influence of Handel has been more than any thing else the means of fostering and cultivating music in Bng'and. ""If you want to judge whether a people are musical or not,"" he said to a Strand Musical Magazine interviewer, "" don't look at their concerts — look at their homes. See the kind of music indulged in there. Now Handel has been the means of bringing gcod music right into the homes."" Mr Manns added that it was Handel who had universally trained the people, and without him they would not be musically what they are to-day. So far as the future of muuc in England is concerned, Mr Manns thinks that the outlook is mo3t brilliant. "" I believe that in the next generation England will accomplish things as great as any that have been kuown in the world of musio, perhaps even greater. We are mor* religious in spirit, more conservative, more inspired by good than any other nation, and Art flourishes in such a soil. I think wonderful things are in store for this land — my country, by the way.""

144,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,71,"FRIDAY, AUGUST 2.","In the Legislative Council this afternoon tbe Native Townships Bill and the Institute of Journalists Bill were passed. A number of bills passed the first reading stage. The Ct-uicil decided to insist on its amendments in the Criminal JCode Bill. The second readfng of the Deceased Husband's Brother's Bill was lost by 18 to 14-. In the House of Representatives to-day the afternoon sittiDg wan again spent in reply iug to questions and discussing various matters on a motion to adjourn. In the evening the chief eveut was the brief debate on the Govera ment Licensing Bill, which was read a second time without a division. EEPLIES TO QUESTIOHS. Replying to Mr Duncan, The Hou. Mr REEVES sad ib was contrary •to the spirit of the Education -Act to ltvj Fpeoml fees for pens and other school requisites. He could not understand why the boards should not supply "" Readers, *' and he thought more books were used iv the schools than were neces sary. Replying to Mr Carntll, Tha Hon. Mr REEVES said he recognised that the servant girls wera as much entitled to a half-holiday as other classes, but he feared that if an amendment, of this kind were introduced into the Shops and Shop Assistants Act Amendment Bill it would ensure its rejec tion in the Council. Ho thought it was as well to in<ike the amending act as little complicated as possible. Replying to Mr Thomas Mackenzie, The Hon. Mr C ADM AN said he was doing his best to assist the farming industry by carry ing agricultural lime as cheaply as possible on the railways. R-plyiug to Mr T. Mackenzie, The Hon. Mr SEDDON said it was true that railway sleepers for the Catlins River rail way bad been brought from Westland, as they were of better quality, and black piue was of inferior quality. Replying tj Mr Massey, The Hon.Mr WARD said every application was considered on its merits by the Lending Board, and advances to settlers were regulated by the realisable value of every security. The Government would in no way interfere with the board when it decided that tha security offered was not sufficient. Replying to Mr G. W. Russell, The Hon. J. M'KENZIE said the matter of marking frozen mutton as ""New Zealand,"" in order to cheak the sale in the Home markets of frozen meat as frozen New Zealand, had frequently been under consideration, bnt no one seemed able to suggest a satisfactory way of doing it. His own opinion was that the best pts<ible mark would be for colonists themselves to send to London tka very best quality of mutton. Replying to Mr Massey, The Hon. J. M'KENZIE said the Agent general would be instructed to examine and report to the Government respecting the success or otherwise of cattle, horses, and sheep la'ely sent from Syduey to England by tha steamer Southern Cross. ADOPTION OF CHILDHEN. The Hon. Mr REEVES asked the House to agree to the amendments made by the Council in the Adoption of Children Bill. — Carried. THE GOVERNMENT LICENSING BILt. The Hon. Mr SEDDON moved the second reading of the Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act Amendment Bill to ameud "" The Alcoholic Liquors Salo Control Act 1893."" He said it gave him great pleasure iv putting so soon after the second reading of Mr M'Nab's bill the views of the Government before the House. There was a great necessity for dealing with this vexed question during the present session, and they bhould approach the matter- with an earnest desire to dual with it so that it should not be a disturbing element session after session. They all knew that the world was made up of compromises, and what they should do was to legislate so that their legislation would meet with the approval of tha great majority of the people of tha colony. He referred to the bill of 1893, wh : ch for the fir»t time gave the people the right of controlling the liquor traffic, and said the present bill pro vided for four issues — namely, whether the number of licenses in a district is to continue, whether they are to be reduced, and whether there are to be licenses or no licenses. It might be said this would complicate the question, but it would b""e a reflection on the men and women of the colony. As to the question of a bare majority, he thought that was fair in deciding for reduction of licenses. The bill before the House contained a proposal for colonial prohi bition. There might be many who would vote fgr reduction but would go against local or national prohibition. He, therefore, thought it fair to give every eUctor four issues to vote upon. If total prohibition were eliminated from the bill ifrwould giva great offence, and he had therefore provided for it in the bill. It might be objected that"" whilst the bill provided for a bare majority in the case of- reduction it allowed a substantial three-fifths majority for local or national pro hibition, but he held that a three-fifths majority was required in a case where the revenue of a local body might be seriously curtailed by refusing to graat any licenses. He firmly believed that if the colony wew polled to morrow it would be in favour by a substantial majority- of local and colonial option. Were they then to have four issues or remain as they were ? If a majority of the House held his views and they agreed to place four is»ues before the people, it was not unreasonable to provide people witk two votes. He asaortod that there was a large section who would not vote for reduction at all, and who would simply vote for local and national prohibition. That, to his mind, would be an illiberal proceeding and should not be allowed. They were told over aud over again by prohibitionists that they wa&ted a straight issue on local or national prohibition, and that was provided I for in the bill. A good deal had been said 1 about the police not doing their duty in enforc ing laws, but in every case where it was proved constable? had not done their duty he had dis charged them. He had been told that con- Etables were in the habit of frequenting public houses, but he should issua a circular to in spectors ihat if this occurred agaiu at any time it should mean discharge from the icrrice, unless they could'prove they were in hotels on business. Mtmbers knew that the police were drafted from the Permanent Artillery, and the circular he should issue would apply to the artillery as well as to the polica. He praised the polica force as a whole, but said a few | exceptions were taken to put a reflection on the whole body, which he did not thiuk right. The same thing applied to hotelkeepers, and because a few of them did not obey the law that waa no reason why all hotelkeepers should be condemned. He t' ought it unwisu to bd con tinually harassing th« people, and people who spent lar*ge sums of money in endeavouring to cater for the public should have some security if they cbej ed the law. He then detailed the | provisions of fche bill, and said the act came j into operation the day before the next elections, and the poll was to be taken on the same day as the general election, which he held was a good provision, but that was a matter that could ba decided by a bare majority of the House. He i had provided in the bill that clubs should be put on the .same footing as hotels, and rail way refreshment room were to be subject to the popular will. S>r R. STOUT congratulated the Premier on haviug made a comiderable advance in the temperance cause since 1893, and ha hoped in two years more he would make a still further advance. The great blot in Mr Seddon's speech waa that he had no euthusiasm for social reform at all, and he looked on this licensing question as- an awkward one which he wished to dispose of with as lit tie friction to his supporters and the publicans as possible. Mr Seddon had no desire to alter the law at all, and tbe only reason he had touched on it was Beciuse if something- were not done some of his party would ba placed iv an awkward position. Under thin bill suppose there were 3000 voters, and 1790 voted for ""no license,"" 1209 for ""reduc tion,"" and one voted to "" remain as at present,"" that one solitary voter would carry the day, and the 2939 would not get their way at all. Aud yet this was called a Liberal measures, brought in iv the interests of democracy. They had to face a great social evil which was doing enormous itijury to their families and causing men aod women to fall every day, and that was why he asked Parliament to deal with the I liquor traffic. They had only to go .to their gaols and hospitals to see the curse which drink had brought to their men and women, and ye!; tbey were to be denied a bare majority. All the Temperance party asked was to remit to the people aad the people to decide this ques tion the same a? other questions were decided by a majority, which surely was not unreason able. The main kernel of this bill was whether there should be a three-fTths or a bare majority, and he pointed out that those who voted tor no licence and for reduction would vote for keeping th<ngs as they were at pre sent. He said they were wasting two million pounds a year by this liquor truffle, which did enormous evil, and he asked the House to take some decided steps to put a stop to this great evil. - Mr LA. WRY never felt more disgusted with the Premier and Government than he did over tbis bill, which had emanated from a political jelly-flab. He asserted that if the colony hid sn opportunity of deciding ou the matter there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of leaving things as they stood at present. This abortion of a bill proposed to shut up public houses, which would simply mean increasing the drinking habits of the people and sly grog-selling. They could not Btop the liquor tmffla by legislation any mjre than they could make people virtuous by all the acts they peßset>s -d Dt NEWMAN said that the most vicious part of the bill was clause 27, which related to increases in licenses. It meant that a committee could grant a license for every 700 people, and he thought the clause should be strongly re sented. He also objected strongly to a license beiug shifted from one house to another. He approved of tbe clause preventing Maori women from getting liquor. He assured the Premier he would not remove this question from the range of practical politics if ha divided the temperance vote. Mr HEKE said the Natives all over bis con stituency had expressed the opinion that liquor was detrimental to them. He congratulated the Premier for the effort he had made to grapple with this question, especially as it was the first time he found himself able to con gratulate that hon. gentleman. • The Hon. Mr SEDDON said Sir R. Stout had charged him with having no ideal, but he asked what practical purpose* were achieved by Sir R. Stout's ideals. He had endeavoured to do his best on this question, but he felt sure that nothing he could do would please Sir R Stout or the extreme prohibitionists, and he should not endeavour to do so, but would try to pass a bill which would be acceptable to the people at large. He replied at some length to the arguments urged against the bill. The motion for the second reading was car ried on the voices. JOTTINGS. The Treasurer thinks the House should be called togethet in future a couple of months earlier so- that the Governmeut might be en abled to- carry on important business without being accused of keeping returns back. The announcement was received with cries of •'Hear, hear."" The Treasurer ttites that it would mean a loss of over £5000 to permit newspai-ers printed in the colony to be sent abroad free of pottage. The suggestion was not likely to be entertained for many yeara.

287,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,214,LETTERS FROM LITTLE FOLKS.,"Dbab Dot,— When reading the little folks' letters I have often thought I should like to write also. My home ia at South Riverton, near to where the proposed harbour is in tended to be formed. It is a very pretty place, and great' numbers of people come here for picnics in summer. I have no brothers or sitters to tell you about, but I have a good few pels. My favourite is a pony called Lucy, which I ride for about two hours every Saturday. Then- 1 have two dogs called Bruce and Ben, two cat! called Tits and Tiger, and a lamb called Moses. I have great fun playing hide and seek with Moses among the racks, but he always finds me, as he gets on tap of the rocks and looks over. Dear Dot, Z am sending 24 stamps for the Kindergarten ; Will you kindly accept of them. — Yours truly, Jessie M'Oallum (aged 11 jears). The Books, Riverton, July 29. [Ye?, Jessie, and if your letter is read to tteai by the teacher, I am sure the little people in the kindergarten will be very pleased with it, and will wish they were playing among the rocks with you and the lamb. — Dot ] ' Dkar Dot, — I saw in the Witness a letter from Minnie Muir, written from the United States of America, asking somebody to give her an account of New Zealand. Before I a* me to Otautau, which is not very long ago, I lived on Stewart I«land, and I am now going to give an account of Stewart Island. Halfmoon Bay is the chief settlement. A steamer runs across once a week and takes mails, goods, and pas sengers. There is also a native settlement, where the Maoris are. A small island, a short distance from Halfmoon Bay, was once the Maori burial place. Sometimes people go there and dg for Maori skulls and »xea and other relics. The Maoris do not like people going there. The Maoris are a very timid rase, and believe in very fuDny things. Peterson's Inlet is a very large bay or bight. AU along the coast line the ferns and trees grow to the water's edge. The little bays and covo3 in«ide make a very beautiful scene. In an other horbour there is a splendid waterfall. It is a broad creek running over a rocky bank, sending the water into a mass of foam. Inland » fthurt distance there are tin mines and a little gold. A few miles away there is an old silver nine. Good crystals are to be found there yet. Stewart Island forest has excellent timber, compri-ing red, white, and black pine, mero, totir*, broadleaf, and white and red camahi ; also rata or irc-nwood, with a dense under growth. There are many varieties of ferns, the best kinds being crape and maidenhair. The flowers are the lawyer, eupplej*ck viue, and rata. The lawyer ia a pretty little white flower, the vine is also white, but a very different shape ; the rata is of a scarlet colour. There are many different kinds of birds, so.iie of which are <fcak*s, pigfoop, ducks, thrushes, tuin, bjack fcirda,- sterlings, .and o th'-rs. The best jingers are the thru-hes, tuis, blackbirds, and starlings. There are also paroquets. The paroquets and kakas are very good talkers when caught young. The ohief occupation of the paople is fishing. They go out about five miles or more from the sbore start ing early in the morning and coming back in the evening. It is a very pretty sight to see the Coats coming (in, their white and brown sails shining in the Bun. They fish chiefly with the line and hook, but some fi»h with nets. The fish caught is chiefly cod, trumpeter, groper, and moki ; they al*o catch mackerel. The cod is frozen, and sent to Melbourne chiefly. The other fish are mostly sent to the local markets and sold there. Other people get their living by mining. Tin and gold are the metals got. Altogether JStewart Island is the prettiest place in New JZia-laud. It is the safebt place for boating. I _tope this letter-is not tco long. — Yours truly, Norman Macrae (Standard V). Otautau, Southland, July 31. [I am afraid, Norman, jour discription of gi c fart Island will make Minnie Muir rogreat tbat her lot has not been cast there instead of in Illinois.— Dot.] Dear Dot, — I am a Babbit, and I live in a h»le^rhich is a great depth. It has been snow ing very hard, and I have great difficulty in getting food. One day I had a narrow escape of being killed. As I was lying sleeping some dega came after me, and gave me a great fright ; then I ran off to my hole as hard is I could run, and the dogs followed me, barking as hard as they, could. I have a great many friends and relations. One of my friends got caught in a trap, and it toek off his leg. It looks very cold outside. The snow is about 3 in deep, and I cannot run very swift in the snow, so the boys come out to try to catch us, but I don't come out ualess I can't help it. I must - stop now as lam very cold and hungry. -* Yours truly, ' A Babbit. Gore, July 31. [Poor old Bun, you are having a hard time of it between traps, guns, poison, dogs, snow, and boys.

It is very cold here at present. I often hear my mistress reading the little folks' letters, so I thought I would write to you. lam two years old, and I like my present home very much. The boys are very kind to me. As soon as the door is open in the morning, I run into the house and get under the stove, and when I hear them say they are going to have breakfast I come out and beg for food. My mistress gives me a nice piece of mutton every morning, and then I climb up on a ehelf and sleap all day. I often hear them say I am too lazy to be of any use, but I dent take any notice of what they say as long as I get plenty to eat. I have three mates, but I don't like them very much. They are not so good-looking as I am. I fancy myself very much, because I heard a young lady saying the other day that I was such a nice cat. Dear Dot, I was weighed the other day, and I am 6lb weight, so you see the cold weather and the hard times in Naseby don't bother me very much. lam sending you three stamps for the Kindergarten Fund.

It is snowing just bow, and it is very cold. We have had very frosty weather lately ; but we cannot grumble, because it is seasonable. 1 have no pets to tell you about except a pony. I had a rabbit, but my brother shot it thinking it, was a wild one. I used to let it run about the house and paddocks just as it pleased. It was eating turnips in one of the paddocks when my brother shot it. The pony is about three and a-half years old. I cannot say she is very honest, because she went into one of the neighbours' houses and tried to steal a loaf of bread. If any strangers go near her she likes to get a kick at them. I am sending you 6d for the Kindergarten Fund. — Yours truly, Taieri Beach, July 28. B. Lavest*. [The pony is not quite so pleasant as Willie the Cat. It was really very impudent to go into a house to steal a loaf of bread. And then just fancy anyone being so unsuspecting as to get within range of her heela. Ido not think he would do so again.

I must now close as my paw is getting tired and my mistress is coming with my food. — Yours truly, . Jacky. East Invercargill, August 1.

162,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,89,OTAMA.,"August 5. — The dreary alternation of snow and rain still continues, varied by an occasional day's fiost. Fining operations are, of course, in a very back«ar.l slate in consequence. Deuaiing SociE.y.— A meeting of the Otama Literary and Deßating Society was h- Id on Tues day evening, July 23, when anonymous papers, contributed by members of the sosiety, were read by the secretary. The papers were upon sucli diverse subj cts as ""(Social Prcgrea*,"" ""Garden ing,"" ""Gloves,"" ""Marks of Chaiacter,"" ""Friend ship,"" and V Courtchip."" Social. — A very enj -.yable scchl was held ia the Otama Church on Tuesday cvtniog, July 30, v/hen the numerous friends of Mr D. Young, ""who ia leaving this district aftera seven or e-ght years' residence, asseurbled 'to bid him goed-bye. The wea'her on the occasion was as disagreeable as could wAI be imngined, and it is evidence of the high esteem in which Mr Young is held that so many turned out in the midst of falling tnow to bid him farewell. An excellent tea was provided by the Indies of the congregation, and after this had been done ample jiifatice to a mu^ial prq granime was gone through. The fi-st -item was a solo, ' Hearts and homes,"" by Master J. 'Steward. This was followed -by the event of the evening — namely, the presentation to Mr Young of gifts .fiom the Rev. P.

In the absence of the suparintendenf-, Mr M'Kinna, Mr W. D. Stewart presented Mr Young with a Revised flible, on behalf of the Sunday School teacheis. In returning thanks for these gifts Mr Young impressed upon those of the younp people who were too old for Sunday School the benefit to be derived from an atttmdance at Mr Ramsay's Friday evening Bible class.

244,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,171,"""THE TRUE STORY OF A VILLAGE PRIRST.""","A large audience assembled on Saturday night to witness the performance in the City Hall of ""The True Story of a Village Priest"" by Messrs Dobton and Martchel's Dramatic Company in conjunction with Messrs Collins, Browne, and Stapleton. The hall was almost crowded and the audience received tbe performance with every manifestation of favour. Between ""A VilUga Priest,"" 'the powerful drama produced in Lmnedin last year by the Brough and Boucinault Company, and ""The True Story of a Village Priest, pie sented on Saturday night, there is no connection and no resemblauce. There is indeed this im portant difference between the conduct of the most important character in the two pieces, that whereas in ""A Village Priest"" the Abbe"" Dubois determines, in order to save an innocent man from punishment on a charge of bloodguiltiness, to reveal certain circumstances of the knowledge of which he became possessed under the seal of the confessional, Father Maurice declines in ""The True Story of a Village Priest"" to disclose the par ticulars of a murder which has been confessed to him even though he is fully conscious that the effect of his silence may be to send to the gallowa an innocent man who is his own bi other. Nut withstanding the serious nature of the plot ia ""The True Story of a Village Priest"" the comic element preponderates in the piece, and this was so well supplied by Miss Ilettie Howarde, Messrs Marschal, Brown, and Collins as to afford abun dant food for merriment of the most hearty kind. Mr Collet Dobson gave a manly and consistent impersonation of Biian O'Neil, a young man of the harum • scarum, good - natured so.t who are so often introduced into Irish pkya. Brian O'Neil it is upon whom a land agent named Macdon»ld, for selfiHh purposes of his own, fastened the suspicion for a crime which was com mitted by a man p»id by the latter, but it is need less to say that, in the end, the identify of the real offender is ascertained. Mr Barrie Marschel mcce>sf ully filled the part of Father Mau-ice, with, which he doubled that of a comedy policeman, his representation of the latter character being provocative of great mirth. Mr H. Saville sus tained with commendable force the part of Gerald Daly, a drink-addicted creature, whom the land agent employes as his tool ; and Mr Cromer and Mr May were respectively cast as Sir G. Howarde, an Knglisb. landlord, and Macdonald, the agent. Miss Millieent Mowbray was a distinctly pleasiug representative of Kthel Howarde, attached to Brian O'Neil and wooed by Macdonald. Miss Hettie Howarde gave valuable assistance in affording the comic relief, and Miss Virginia Clay toa played a email part Messrs Collins and Browne appeared in a couple of subsidiary parts, their representation of which offered reasonable ground for their introducing a variety ""turn"" that was received with such boisterous applause that a repetition of a portion of it was cleanly a necessity. The principal performers were twice "" called "" before the curtain. At ope of the in tervals Mr Marschel thanked the audience for their liberal patronage, and stated that it was proposed to stay in Dunedin for a term, giving perform ances on the Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday nights of each week.",0,-1.973966152,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

136,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,63,THE ELDORADO DISASTER.,"RECOVERY OF THE BODIES. Melbourne. August 3. The whole of the bodies of the eight men entombed in the El Dorado mine have been recovered. They are horribly disfigured. The eight men lost in the El Dorado mine appear to have slowly succumbed to the ex haustion of the air. On Daw kin's billy were soratohed the words on the morning of the accident : "" Feeling weak — want air — God forgive vs — God reign fortivtr."" When the relief party reached the bodies of the victims in the El Dorado mine the sight which met their gaze was horrifying in the extreme. The stream had extended in large volume to the end of the workings, and almost reached its limits, When the party entered the drive it stood about 2ft in depth, and was an accumulation of water that drained through the slum from the workings. There was a distance of 20ft from the flood gates to the face of the workings. It was this retreat to which Burke, Dawkins, Crane, and Armstrong rushed when the inburst occurred, and they were forced to remain there until removed by the relief parties. » Apparently the chamber into which they retreated was dry for some time, but they were entirely powerless to escape. The unfortunate men could have had only one thought — viz., that they were entombed beyond all hope of rescue, and had simply to await their deaths. How long they remained alive cannot be aticert allied, but it it conjectured from the quantity of air remaining between the slum and the end of the drive that there would be sufficient to last them for 24 hours. The first body which came to view was that of Edgar Crane, who was lying on his back peaceably at rest, with one arm beneath him and the other extended across the breast. He was clothed just as when last seen. The features were not in any way disturbed, and he apparently laid down from exhaustion and died calmly. Close to him lay Charles Dawkins. His face was towards the ground. He waß on his knees, and seemed as if he had spent the last minutes in prayer. His bands were not clasped, but doubtless had fallen for ward when the end came. Like his comrade Crane, Dawkins was fully dressed. Armstrong was next found four feet away from Crane, lying prostrate. He had stripped himself of his clothes, and only had a flannel band around his waist. His clothes were thrown about in various places, and the last few minutes of his life can only be imagined, but no doubt they were terrible. Probably he loßt his reason before he buc cumbed, tearing off his clothes in sheer desperation. Dawkins evidently also at tempted to take off his clothes, but could not draw the trousers over the boots. The air gradually becoming exhausted and more Yit.iated at each breath, their sufferings became keener, until at length even the clothing was oppressive. Armstrong doubt less survived the longest, and at last threw himself down in the intensity of his suffer ings and died. Burke was the last man found, about 20ft away' from the other three. His bead was turned towards the face of the drive, in the same manner as Dawkins, and he had knelt dewn while awaiting the end. Eneebone must have made a desperate attempt for life, but had been overwhelmed in the mullock. He was found lying face downwards. The body was hardly recog nisable ; both legs were broken and other marks proved that the body was thrown with great force against some hard substance.- August 5. It took nearly six hours to completely decipher the messages scratched on the cans of the El Dorado miners. All the men, as well as Dawkins, wrote brief pathetic messages. August 6 The last messages of the miners buried in the El Dorado mine has created a painful Bensation. No one in the district believes for a moment that the messages were written at 6 o'clock on the same (Saturday) morning as the disaster occurred. Miners, as a rule, are not given to write such hopeless mes sages two hours after finding themselves blocked In. Moreover, knowing they were entombed for at least a few days, they would husband their scanty food and the supply of tea. The messages were clearly not written on the billies until the tea was exhausted. The general opinion is that the poor fellows wrote their last letter days after the disaster occurred.",0,-1.981772527,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,13,THE VALUE OF HOME-GROWN FOOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MILK.,"By Qilbeet Mubrat, ElvastoD, Derbyshire. (Fbom Oub English Agbicultubal Corkh sfondent.) I claim your clemency for a few brief remarks on the ancient history of rural life. From remote periods, and in all countries, the ownership of herds and flocks was held to embody the winning charm of rural simplicity. The daily wants of nomadic races as regards food were chiefly de pendent on the milk of their herds and flocks, whilst the skins of the animals furnished them, protection from the vicissitudes of a changeable climate. Milk in a pure state is almost tho only natural food we possess capable of maturing and sustaining animal life ; here the different chemical constituents of a per fect food ar<j combined in the relative proportions necessary to sustain the functions of the body, a careful study of which will enable us to practi cally apply the lessons here taught to the success ful blending of foods moit suitable to the wants of tho animal without the danger or liability of waste. THE HISTORY OF DAIUY-FARMING IN GREAT BRITAIN embraces a period of nearly 800 years. The different systems of husbandry first obtained through the varying circumstances of, soils and climatic influences. The rich alluvial soils of the river valleys are situated in a mild, moist climate, and although the pastures are generally abundant on such soils, the quality is much better suited for the production of milk that it ia for that of meat. DAIRY DISTRICTS. Down almost to the commencement of the past decade the principal dairy in Great Britain were -""Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset on'tbe south-west ; parts of Leicester, Derby, and Staf ford in the Midlands ; Cheshire and Lancashire in the North Midlands ; Craven and Wensleydale in Yorkshire ; with Ayrshire, Wigton, and Kircud brietht in the south-west of Scotland. A peculiar and distinctive system of management obtained in each county. Cheese and butter were the the chief dairy products. Thirty years ago scarcely any artificial foods were used beyond a few roots or brewers' grains during the winter months. The cheese-making season seldom covered a longer period than seven months of tho year. • .... EARLY HISTORY OF DAIRYING. As early as the middle - of the twelfth century the county of Chester held a high reputation for the superior quality of its cheese. Marshall, in his "" Rural Economy of Gloucestershire,"" mentions the superior cheese of that county. THE MILK TRADE. One of the earliest record«d attempts to supply an urban population with pure milk was that of Mr Gurwen, of Workington Hall, Cumberland, the food of the cows consisting chiefly of brewers grains, roots, hay, and a small allowance of oil cake. The yearly period of lactation never ex ceeded 220 days, the cost of keep and attendance was jEIOIOs, andthegross value of the produce j£lß. About the same period — 1810 — the Willowbank Dairy was established in a suburb of Glasgow by Mr William Harley, an extensive manufacturer, with the view of supplying hit workpsople with pure milk. Having staited with the modest com plement of 24 cows, in less than six years the average number of cows had risen to 260. These were equal to the entire number of cows kept by the dairymen in the city of Glasgow. The lyatem of feeding and management pursued wa3 that known as the "" soiling,"" or house-feeding, system. The food} chiefly used were hay aad artificial grasses, grown in rotation on cultivated land, sup plemented by fresh draff from the distilleries and large quantities of bean meal. Mr Harley's prac tical experience confirmed the opiniori that one acre of grass fed in the stalls, in conjunction with a fair allowance of artificial foods, produced as much milk a? live acres pastured in the ordinary way. Where dairy cows are comfortably housed in a well- ventilated building maintained at a uni form temperature, and where the modern system of sanitation is strictly carried out — where the best qualities of food arc blended, with free access to pure soft water — the yield of milk is not only greater, but in quality and flavour the produce is much superior to that produce 1 by cows giazing on gotd pastures. Wherever the soiling system is carried out the cow shed? should be furnished with small open yards having sufficient space for six cows to exercise for an hour or two each day ; this tends to promote and maintain a healthy system. With home-grown cereals at pre sent prices such a system demands the serious consideration of the dairy-farmers of the pre sent day. I hold that at no very remote period this will be the universal practice on all lowland farms (with the exception of the best grazing land), whether grass, tillage, or mixed occupa tions. The improvement of the stock of the farm by breeding and rearing a superior class of animals — feeding off the surplus stock — can best be effected by the use of a superior class of bulls and a careful and intelligent selection of the best, females. Reverting to the by no means remote period of 40 years_ ago, throughout the then reputed dairy counties in the United Kingdom — from Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset on the west, Leicester, Derby, Stafford. Chaster, and Lanca shire in the North Midlands, through the dales of Yorkshire and the valea of Cumberland — artificial foods of auy kind were seldom used ; even roots were only used to make an inferior quality of hay and straw more palatable. Throughout the whole of the?e counties cheese making in one form or other was the leading ' dairy industry. The use of artificial foods for the purpose of producing milk for cheese-making was viewed with derision, and even treated with ridicule. The cheesemakers of Ayrshire and the south-wectern districts of Scotland were the first to put the use of auxiliary foods to a practical test in the production of milk, though the results were largely dependent on tbe intricacies of science ; nevertheless, shrewd observers gradually became convinced of the value of bean meal for increasing the quantity and improving the quality of their cheese. About the date mentioned Mr Harding, a celebrated Cheddar maker, was in vited to Ayrshire in order to teach the native farmers the Cheddar system. Mr Harding was too shrewd a man not to appreciate the value of bean meal, and, as a natural sequence, recom mended its use to his brother farmers on his return ; and by this means it established a favour able reputation in the cheese-making counties of the south-west of England. The vicinity of the great mining and manufacturing industries, the rapid increase of population, and the extension of railways gave a general impatus to the production of milk in order to meet the growing demands of those great hives of industry. This tended to a more extended growth of roots and forage crop 3 and a more general use of cereals and other auxiliary foods. To satisfy this demand milk is now conveyed by rail a distance of 250 to 300 miles. The conveyance of milk from Derby to London dates from 1869 ; prior to this cheese and butter were the only saleable products. The cows were timed to calve between the end of March and the first week in May. At the date of which I write the me of artificial foods was scarcely known ; with the extension of the London milk trade their use rapidly increased. In the parish from which I write, dur ng the greater part of the seventies on many farms th,a expenditure on artificial foods equalled that of the rent of the land during 1893-a year in which tho yield of milk was 15 to 20 per cent, below the average. ""From reljable sources of information I estimate the quantity of milk sent from Derby s™? J& rail at 10 million gallons. The same year 6,000,000 gal were dealt with in factories ; one of these handled during the year 1,261,184«i1. whilst in another 538,000 gal were dealt with. In the case of a town trade, or for creameries, where a winter supply is essential, this can only he done by the use of large quantities of artificial foods. Previous to the iinprovemeut in dairy manage ment, gra«s in summer and hay in winter, were the only focd of the dairy cows ; those found to be regular breeders were often kept to a very advanced ago. Hence it is obvio""s that the quality of the milk was generally of a low order. The hay crops were generally allowed to remain uncut to a late perk a of the season ; the heavy night dews and lessening period of sunshine still further reduced the chances of securing an already vastly deteriorated crop. The luildings were often in adequate to the wants of tho farm ; the cows were turned out for several houis daily under all weathers. The entire system of management has baen completely revolutionised during the period already mentioned on many of the large estates ia .the county ; tlu farm buildings are' not surpassed by those of any county in England. IMPROVED SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT. Except in the case of a few cottager^ who keep two or three cows, there is no soiling system carried out on a largo scale ; yet many of, the best managers, both cheesemakers and milk-seller*, use a small quantity of artificial foods during the euuimer, technically called "" licking."" -The low price of cereals, and their recognised value as milk producers, are rapidly extending the uee of auxiliary foods throughout the year. A practical proof of the value of artificial foods on the quality of the milk is afforded by the. experience of a creamery dealing with themilk of 1200 cows drawn from a radius of over three miles, which is suffi ciently representative of the management of the district. A general test is applied daily, and the milk of each contributor ia separately tested at -leabt weekly ; here it is only in is dated cases where the butter fat descends below 3 per ceut. The kinds and quantity of artificial food to ucc with out incurring the liability to waste is one of tho tuaiu conditions which should guide the practico of the farmer. Chiefly from the view of economy in labour, many prefer the use of cake 3to that of meals. My experience runs in this direction. For fattening cattle on pastures I prefer decorticated cotton cake of good quality ; for fattening cattle in the stalls, in conjunction with roots, meals, hay, straw, or other dry food, then I would select good linseed cake. For the production of milk of the first quality there ia nothing equal to a judicious mixture of home-grown cereals ; many kinds of foods particularly rich in oil are not con ducive to a fine quality, more particularly in the case of butter. Swede*, mangles, and common turnips fed in large quanties are objectionable ; the most objectionable food of all is stale breweri' grains. Several of the foods we have named con tain a. large percentage of water. Fed at a low temperature, the whole of the heat-producers they contain is spent in raising the water held in suspension to the normal temperature of the body ; in addition to this, a considerable amount of heat producers is wasted by radiation. We have still much to learn in compounding the most economi cal and efficient ration for the different pur poses required for building up the bone and muscle of a young growing animal. The food should be rich in albuminoids. In tbe case of animalti which are subjected to physical exertion, the ration should be rich in carbo-hydrates ; thii demonstrates the value of the soiling system in the economy of food. In the case of the dairy cow, the yield and quality of the milk ar« influenced to a considerable extent by the breed, character, and age of the animal, and to a much greater extent by the quality of the food and water with which it is supplied. From a strictly financial point of view the summer and wintei feeding should vary considerably. Oti the beat pastures it will pay to use auxiliary foods fromtha day they are turned into the pastures until thej return to their winter quuters. The besfi mixture is 2lb per day of dried grains, lib wheat, aud lib pea meal"". The3e foods tend to increase the quality of the milk, and correct the too laxative effects of the grass during wet weather. If the object be the production of dairy goods"" of the finest quality, the beßt foods alone must, be vied. Formerly, heated or inferior cereal grains vrere considered good enough for the cow*. Now that competition has become bo intense, the British farmercan onlymaintain his position byus ingthe best home-grown foods. I was much pleased with the remarks made by Professor M Connoll the other day as to the difference in the value of oatmeal a^ food for a higher grade of organised life. A student of physiology who for the first time visits the mills, factories, and streets of youi great hives of industrious toilers, is astonished at the evident deterioration in the physique of tho young men and maidens, due for the most part to the everlasting use of tea and white bread of the finest quality, manufactured from the pro ducts of other lands, and frequently not of the highest nutrive quality. The former should be SUBSTITUTED BY SWEET SEPARATED MILK. During the present range of low prices, I urga you to increase the cereal production of youi lands, in order to supply the necessary wants oi your stock. Every farm should be self-supporting, both in the matter of food and of stock. If tins system were rigidly carried out, the British farmer would suffer less from tho fluctuations in prices. Whatever the state of the weather, directly we reach the longest day.tbe yield of milk begins to ehiink. In ordtr to maintain the standard some what longer, the allowance of artificial foods should be increased, and the albuminoid ration raised from Itosital to 7. Lower temperature and increasing exercise demand a greater expen diture of heat and fat producers. The ordinary pastures of the dairy countio3 generally respond to a more liberal treatment. Bones have long been used on the Cheshire cow pastures with satisfactory results. Now I think cheap phos phates, in conjunction with kainit, for the supply of potash and sulphate of ammonia or nitrate of soda, when applied in the early winter months.give a quick and liberal return at a moderate outlay ; where phosphates and potash are liberally used the nitrogen scare is an illusory bogie. Onp hundredweight per acre of sulphate of ammonia adds both to the quantity and quality of the pro duce. Five years ago a field of 40 acres on the 'upper alluvium was taken in band. For more than 40 years the land was held by a tenant who stocked chiefly with horses, both summer and winter, UDtil all the finer grasses had disappeared. JThe sou was chiefly occupied by tansy—Tanace ■turn vulgare (the root is creeping ; every part of the plant is bitter, and emits a strong odour not relished by slock)— and crested dogs tail (Cynosu rus cristatus), a grass of inferior quality. Since then the land has had two separate dressings of 4cwt of basic slag, 3cwt of kainit, and lewt of sulphate of ammonia per acre. The t*nsy, which Aad almost gained complete possession of the soil, lias to a considerable extent disappeared, and been succeeded by the finer varieties of grasses ""and clovers. Most dairy pastures dotted over the length and breadth of the land would respond to liberal treatment. The soil on the coal measures, the glacial drift, the millstone grit, the new red sandstone, and even the carboniferous limestone readily respond to liberal treatment. £The first improvement is that known as *' knifing."" This implement is constructed in the form of a grubber armed with broad steel shares working to a depth of Bin . ,to ' 12'n, moving the whole of the soil with out disturbing the surface, except it be the small groove left by the tine carrying tbe broad share. 3Jy this means the soil is loosened and aerated, and nitrification is promoted and new combinations formed. The work should be done in the late autumn or early winter. The land iB then thoroughly chain-harrowed, and the phosphates, sulphate of ammonia, kainit, and other fertilisers applied ; it is tben rolled and laid in for the ■winter. The cost of the cultural operations will be about 16s per acre ; the value of the improve ment, if skilfully carried out, can hardly be esti mated. My experience of tbe deteriorating effect of the use of nitrogenous manures on the growth of clovers, when uced in moderate quantities in conjunction with phosphates and potaah, is not confirmed by practical experience. The great enemies of the clover families are twitch and fogged pastures.

312,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,239,OUR AUSTRALIAN LETTER.,"(Feom Our Own Correspondent.) - Melbourne, July 20. TH,E VICTORIAN TARIFF. . . Great interest continues to be taken in the tariff debate in the Victorian Parliament. It is proving a close fight and an exciting one. Woollens and sulphuric acid had afforded tbe liveliest discussion up to tbe time I last wrote. Since, then the biggest fights have been over axles, candles, and hats. The high tariff party -got badly beaten till they came to hats. Axles were reduced by no less than 60 and 50 per cent., which was the Freetrade (or low tariff) party's greatest victory. Candles, which paid 2d per lb, are to be reduced to l£d and to Id ■ after the expiry of 18 months - that is, after the beginning of 1897. Hats produced a savage battle. All the low tariff supporters could secure was a reduction from 3s to 2s 6d. The great majority of hats are sold at from 5s to ■ 10s. Fancy protection to the extent of 2s 6d eaoh h&t. Virtually, of course, it is prohibition. So the fight goes on. When they get to boots ■ there will be another terrific struggle. The House swarms-nightly with manufacturers, who ""lobby"" in the .most unblushing manner.- In fact it is scandalous. And remember also that the Government is on the high tariff side, and, angry at so many defeats, has been whipping up its supporters on several of the items. Yet in spite of all the good work is progressing. The next general election in this colony will be fought straighter than ever on Protection v. Freetrade ; and- I am positive Free-trade will come back with an increased majority-. Gene rally speaking the divisions have seen some four or five, on an average, as the balance on the Freetrade side. FATAL MINING ACCIDENT. A terrible disaster ocenrrtd at the Broken Hill South mine on the 18th, whereby eight men lost their lives and two others were seriously injured. The accident occurred at about 4 o'clock, just when the men were changing shifts. The men were engaged in working the north sulphide stopes at the back of the 400 ft level. Indications were noticed in the morning that the ground in that locality was showing signs of shifting. The men were warned by the underground manager, Mr Sam Mayne, and had reached the main level when the ground gave way, an extensive displacement - fcttking-pl&ce. The fall of so large a body of ore "" caused a tremendous ooncass'on in the air, and : the unfortunate men were dashed about in all directions with terrible force against the timbers ' and walla of the ddve, causing a wholes*? e lo3b ' of life. Directly news of the calamity was • known on the surface Dr Groves was tele phoned for, and promptly arrived on the scene. ' The injured men/ -whose names are Fanter - and Mortimer, received first attention. Both ' are young men, Panter being a well-known footballer. Dr Groves ordered their removal to the hospital, where they were taken with - out delay. He then turned his attention to the others, bat they were all past help, and all he could dp was to pronounce them dead. The following ia a libt of thesi killed : — Arthur Trembath, married, who leaves a wife and four children 'residing at Moonta ; Charles Nebon, 'married man ; William Arthur, married man with three children ; Benjamin Snell, married man ; Frank Pearce, married man ; John Lee, married man ; George Holmes, married man ; Wijliam M'Loish, single man. The bodies of the victims of the disaster ,-were bronghb to the surface singly, wrapped as carefully as possible in canvas and strapped to a piece of 10 by 2 timber. On being landed at the brace the bodies were taken io the carpen ter's shop, and when they were ranged in a row they formed a mournful spectacle. The faces of the men were blackened, but there seemed but little mutilation. The general manager says there were about 15 men on the level at the time ■ of the accident. The two men who were only injured were quite 200 ft away in the drive from where the accident occurred. The extent of the ground affected would probably extend to / the tenth floor, and he would imagine that the area of ground which broke loose was about 50ft long and 50ft wide. He further stated that in all his experience of mining, extending over 50 years, be had never known such a citcs'ropho t.o cccur in any property of which he had the management. ALISON SMITH v. SYME. The jury are expected to return a verdict on this day of writing in Mr Alison Smith's libel action against the Age. This will be the twenty-ninth day of hearing, bo that the cost to the defendant, even if he gets the verdict, will be great. But it seems impossible that he can get a *<}«&#. If he does, then sorely Mr Alison Smith may exclaim that there is no justice in Victoria. For the Chief Justice has summed up most distinctly in his favour — at any rate on the majority of the important counts, of which, br-the-bye, there are no less than 25 in all. Of course Mr Alison Smith cannot get a verdict on all ; but he certainly deserves one on the more important of them. He withdrew the allegation of personal malice against Mr Symo over the truck which Mr Synie wished introduced on the railways. He had made a grievous mistake in his dates. Instead of the first article about him appearing within a fortnight of the truck episode, it did not appear for about two years afterwards. The fact that he had been grievously mistaken in so important a matter certainly weakened him with the jury. The chief point in Mr Smith's favour made by Sir John Madden was in regard to the Age's allegation that he had run up the locomotive working expenses to such an extent as to ruin the railways. His Honor showed that the comparison of locomotive expanses with gene ral revenue for the purpo-e of nho*iug what the writer had asserted was wholly illusory. The only test as to whether the locomotive expenses had risen or fallen was to compare them with the train mileage run. He went on to* say that the Age comparison was "" wholly wrong and absolutely indefensible."" The Age writer had' fallen into the blunder of wrongly comparing locomotive expenses with general revenue, and this blunder, (hough it might have been made in the first instance in g-od faith, ""had been pursued to the end with a confidence which was not merited."" This expression of censure was based on the fact that though the error had been pointed out, the Age refused to correct or amend its deductions. Sir Jobn plainly stated therefore, that the asseition tbab Mr Alison Smith bad practically ruined the railways was wholly unwarranted. As the gr&vest of the libels were founded on this assertion of Mr Smith's wild extravagance, it is impossible to see how the jury can avoid giving him a verdict on the m»jor couufs. The Age was greatly disturbed at his Honor's lucidity on this very important point. In a paragrnph next raorniug it wrote :— "" His Honor's views on the figures undtr considera tion produced surprise. The p'aiutiff not having raised, or at all events tmphasised, the matter in this way as a ground for his claim to damages, counsel for the defendant had not argued it. The plaintiff appeared to share in the surprise of the other parties, but to wel come his Honor's observations as helpful light from without on a difficult matter."" As Mr Smith had cross-examintd on the point every witness who could throw light upon it, and patticularly Mr Woodroffe, one of the Railway Commissioners, and had produced a bewilder ing chart of figures to prove the ab-urdifcy of tbe Age's figures, the above paragraph certainly appror.chtd the imprudent, and Mr Smith so cousidered it, for he brought ib under his Honor's notice as a co; t^mpfc of court, but Sir Jehu gooi.-humouivdly laughed the thing av»ay. THE WEATHER. While we hear doleful accounts from New Zealand of rain and snow lasting for weeks, Melbourne has suffered from drought. The rainfall this year is 4-in behind the average, and July has been a very dry month — steady, dryiug, cold north winds with only a very occa sional, shower of the lightest description. In New South Wales and Queensland severe frosts have occurred. Trains covered with white frost have run ibto Sydney, and the tempera ture was so low in Sydney that there was ice in Hyde Park. At the Observatory the lowest reading of the thermometer was 24 6. Mr Russell says; — ""We found the thermometer frozen to the grass, a sixteenth of an inch of ice holding it. The place was white all about the grounds, and 6V( n on the bare ground there was frost."" At Toowoomba, in Queensland, 12deg of frost was registered on July 1 ; at Warwick, 16deg ; and at CambooyA. as much as 20deg. In Toowcomba the cold was so intense that at Milbrook, the residence of Mr W. H. Groom, M L A., one plum tree was covered with icicles hangiug from the branches some 6 in or 7in long. IS IT A TRUE BILL ? In an article about the telephone, the Aus tralasian writes :—"": — "" In hilly Dunedin every body who is anybody is on the system. Ladies ring each other up fir3t thing in the morning and last thing at night (to fay nothing about; the long conversation which take place at middle d»y) to inquire how lan is, to tell Jessie to meet Nelly at Haines's by 11, cr to report that Bobby has' proposed' at lest. When an engagement comes off in Dunedin the rash on the telephone systtin is tremendous. Tbe dis tracted exchange Las to answer a hundred simultaneous ring?. Every lady is impatient to be first to tell the news, and she calls up number after number till friends living eight and 10 miles down tte PeniDSula have been sent to bed with EomethiDg hnppy to dream about."" MISCELLANEOUS. The Newcastle schoolboy is opposed to womanhood suffrage, as the New South Wales Premier discovered on July 18 when address ing a gathering of children there. Speaking to the girls first, he said, "" When you grow up to womanhood jrou will probably be given votes."" Then to the boys he remarked, ""You boys will not object to the girls having a vote, will you ? "" To his great astom-hment, and to the amaze ment of the other visitors, a most vigorous •• Yes "" was given in reply, When the Premjpr recovered his . composure he merely said, "" Perhaps the matter will be settled long before you have a say about it,"" and retired. The unusual spectacle of a police court open for the transaction of business on the Sabbath was presented at the Water Police Court in Sydney on July 14, when Mr Smithers, S.M., dealt with charges against seamen who had been creating a Saturday night disturbance. Their steamer, the Tanais, of the Messageries line, had to leave port at 2 o'clock on Sunday after noon, and as she could not proceed to sea with out the.mcD, the court sat to dispose of the charge. A great literary curiosity is on view at the shop of Mesara Melville, Mullen, and Slade. It is a promissory note for £624- 14s 7d, drawn at 12 months by James Ballantyne and Co., of Edinburgh, and accepted by Sir Walter Scott, of Abbotsford, whose signature appears at the bottom of the bill and not across its face. The document is evidently one of that mass of accommodation bills which the great novelist so rashly accepted for the publishing firm at the time Johh B*llantyne was seized with a fever of speculation, and when he might be heard whistling for his clerk, John Stevenson, from his sanctum behind the shop, and exclaiming, ""Jock, you lubber, fetch ben a sheaf o' stamps."" This littla slip cf paper, with its faded ink, was therefore OLe of the primary causes 'of the financial disaster which ruined poor Scott, taxed bis brain almost to exhaus tion, clouded the latter years of his life, and shortened his days.",0,-1.987954089,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the death penalty is not to be reserved for persons who with cold - blooded deliberation set them selves to destroy helpless infants for money, clearly it can be reserved for no one at all. The man who commits the foulest murder in a paroxysm of anger, or even of avarice, is not so lost as the woman who is constantly on the lookout for infants to murder at go much a head. On a former occasion we mentioned that the delay in executing a sentence necessitated by the new provisions for appeal might be seized upon as a reason for not executing it at all. No matter how wicked the individual may have been, it revolts humanity that a human being should be kept for weeks or months alternating between an eoataoy of hope and an agony of despair. There is much reason to believe that the worst criminals are not subject to extremes of cither emotion. Bat that is a consideration which, if true, does not weigh with the or dinary individual, who can only judge by the standard of the normal. All he knows is that to keep human being 3 in an agony of doubt as to the safety of tbeir lives is the refine ment of cruelty, to which he is averse. Obviously we shall have to overcome that feeliag, or abandon the provisions for appeal in criminal cases, or abolish capital punish ment. The last (like the one preceding) should only be carried out by direct process of law. Had the sen tence on Mrs Dean been commuted, the abolition would have moved far towards accomplishment without any such process. There is one great central argument for, and another against, the infliction of the death penalty. The argomeut for is that its influence as a deterrent is infinitely greater than any alternative punishment which oivilisation would permit. Of this there can be little doubt. Tha man who is in safety and comfort is always ready to declare (and perhaps, to believe) that he wo aid prefer death to imprisonment for life, but the un happy creature who is confronted with the necessity for choosing invariably olinga to life. Captain Dretu*. the French traitor, has come through degradation unspeakable, and is now on the deadly lale de S.Uut, suffering the daily horrors of a living tomb. But when on detection he had a loaded revolver placed before him he declined to use it. Tha fear of death is dread and universal. There are many men who would on the whole prefer a life in a modern prison to a life of work. It seems odd, but it is unhappily true. On the other side, the great objection to the death penalty is that it is irrevocable. Error must exist while humanity lasts. No wisdom can guard against it ; no system can exclude it. But the error which carries with it the death penalty can never be redressed. That is a very grave consideration. It is not for us to attempt to balance the arguments, one against the other — that would involve calling up the numberless minor considerations with which each side may be supported, and it would lead to no dftfinito conclusion. The law as it standß at present is clear, and distressing as the execu tion of it may be, the Government were right not to chirk the du*y. Judge BicliiuoHd. By the death of Justice Richmond fche colony loses a judge whose place will be very hard to fill. The late judge has nerved New Zealand with supreme ability for nearly half a century, and he has bean a Supreme Court jadga eicoa tho time many thousands ef colonists now rising into middle agawerein the alphabet. Audvrifch rare ability and faithfalness has he performed fche work of his high office daring jiU that time. For he was much more than a good judge — he was a most distinguished one. There are lawyers and lawyers, and these make judges and jtidges. You may get the judge who is a lawyer and nothing more. If he is sound, painstaking, and acute there Is little reason for complaint. These were bat the founda tion of Judge Richmond's accomplishments. He was in addition a man of Bolid learning, of very high ability, and of quite remarkable insight. His judgments were always lumin ous as well as sound, and there was a certain distinction in bis mode of thought and style of expression on the beach and off it by no means common in the front rank of the legal profession, or for that matter in the front racks of any profession. Like the late Chief Justice Higginbotham of Victoria, Judge Richmond was really qualified to take a pro minent position in his profession in any quarter of the world ; and like many men who are fitted for a large sphere of action, he was quite content to do his duty faith fully in a small one. The question of finding a successor for such a man becomes a serious consideration. A vacancy on the Supreme Court Bench is becoming increasingly difficult to fill. In the early days of Australia ambition drew many young men of brilliant parts to the colonies. The competition at Home was then, as now, keen enough to choke at least political avenues to distinction, while the colonies offered a scope that seemed likely to widen indefinitely. At the same time there was then no prospect of private practice at the colonial bar sufficient to discount the attrac tions of public life, and through public life most of the great colonial judges have won their way to the Bench, Hence there were really giants in those days when the popula tion was small, and the giants are lew in these days when the populations are com paratively large. Formerly it was not dif ficult to select men of distinguished talents as well as legal attainments ; now the dif ficulty is to get a really capable lawyer, not mentally or constitutionally disqualified, who will accept the position. If Me Seddon sets any value on his future reputation he will take care that suspicion of party does not defile the appointment. The Attorney-general for the time being is 'usually held to be entitled to an appoint ment of the kind if ho oares to take it. Sir Patrick Buckley would, we feel sure, earn the respeot of the colony by refraining from pressing any suoh claim. It will not be possible to get a successor to Judge Rich mond of intellectual attainments comparable to his, bat if the filling of the vacancy is approached in a proper spirit it will be possible to get the best man available — wbioh is something. Working the Oracle. There is one thing that can always be safely predicted as the outcome of an alteration of the tariff — namely, an increase of reve nue. That is never stated to be the object, bat it is the in variable result. Another thing to be noted is that every auoh alteration is directly due to the appeals of individual protectionists, who have no other object in view but their own interests. The system of gathering in formation by commission assists these gentle men powerfully. A commission comes round and invites evidence as to ""anoma lies"" and so forth, and of course the gentlemen in question are eager to give such evidence as suits themselves. No report of the proceedings is published, and the general public remain in ignorance of what is being done and intended until the new tariff is made known, when it is gene rally too late to interfere. The consumers who are chiefly affected have no voice in the matter at all. They have nothing to trust to at all bat the good sense of the com missioners, and the good sense of the commissioners ift hardly likely to withstand a mass of evidence pouring in from oae side only. Let us take one case merely as an example of hosts of others. Mr Jame&Neil describes himself as a herbalist and manufacturing chemist carrying on business in Gteerge street. Mr Neil is a strong protectionist, as all know who read tbe papers. He volun teers evidence before tbe commission, hie evidence being to the effect that if manu factured drugs had the duty raised from 15 to 30 per cent., and patent medicines to 40 per cant., he (Mr Neil) would profit by the change— at the expense of the public. Here i 8 the sort of thing : The Chairman (of Commission) : Supposing the duty were raised as you propose, would not you and others be likely to gat all the busi ness? Mr Neil : It would help us a good deal, and would keep grccars and others from spoiling the trade [italics outs] by telling a two and six pttuny article at a profit of Id or 2d. Now they are selling a box that cost Is 2d at Is 3d or Is 3£d. It a duty of 40 per cent, were imposed it might raise tbe-ra to li 6d, which would be a reasonable price, — This it will be seen is but a naked demand that the colony should interfere to prevent grocers from selling articles cheap so that Mr Neil might be enabled to cell them dear. And the same sort of evidence is all through the report. Let it be borne in mind that this continual tinkering with the tariff is done at the request of persons personally interested, and that, as we have said, it invariably results in increased taxation, and that, too, of a kind that can rarely or never be remitted. We are stoadily going up 5 and 10 per cent, at a time, although colonies like Victoria that have crippled themselves with protection are at this very moment compelled to struggle desperately to get their tariff re duced. The report of the tariff is a very bulky document, and neither useful nor in teresting — excepb to show how the oracle is worked among the protectionists, and how the public is victimised. Life in Uie East End. There are many thousands of people in the colonies who are familiar enough with the name of the Esutt Bad (ib is significant that no closer description is necessary), but have only tne vaguest idea what the real life of its in habitants is like.* Perhaps life in other quarters is all the more comfortable in con sequence of that ignorance ; bat if any one ia desirous of acquiring a knowledge of what is at once so painful and bo sordid he cannot do better than read Arthur Morrlson'f "" Tales o£ Mean Streets."" The book when it came out attracted much attention, which was ndeed its due, for tho keenness and fidelity of the author's observation could scarcely be exceeded, while the realistic power of tho writing ia painfully stamped on every page. The darkest and most disagreeable picture in the book is "" Liserunt,"" an extract or two from which and from "" That Brute Simmons "" —a tale of roach lighter hue — will give a good idea of a remarkable book. The former is a study of Bast End life to which many people would object, but it is bo obviously drawn from life that there is really no sufficient reason for suppressing it. L'zerunt was originally entered in an East End Register as Elizabeth Hnnt, and first appears in the book as a girl of 17 who worked in a pickle factory at 103 per week. Here is her description then :—: — She was somo jhirg of a beauty. Thai is to aay, ber cheeks were very red, her teeth were very large an! white, and her nose was small and snub, and her fringe was long and shiny ; while her fa.cc, new washed, was susceptible of a high pclhh. Many such girls are married at 16, but Lizerunt was belated and had never a bloke at all. The "" bloke "" came at 18, however, in the pereon of B.Hy Chops, a dhagteßable speci men even of a young East lfi^ler, living a sort of parasitic life upon his mother, who worked a manglo. I* was on<j cver-ing on her way home from the pickle factory that L'z^r «nt first perceived that Billy was serious : — Far Bil'y Chopp, floucbing in the opposite direction, lurched aerts* fcho pavumeut as i&ey met, and taking the nearer hand from kih pocket, caught and twisted her M-m, bumping her against the wall. ""G*rn,"" said Liz »runt, greatly pleased ; ""le* go."" For she knew fchit this was lore. "" Where are yer auf to, Lizer ? "" ""'Ome o' course, chee'Uy. Le' go "" ; and she snatched — in vain — at Billy's hafc. The meeting ended in Lizeruab accepting an invitation to meet Billy at Whit Monday's fair on Waußtead Flats. The course of true love, however, does not run smooth even in the Eaßt End, and this particular Monday saw a fight between Billy Ohope and Sam Oar dew, in which the latter was so decidedly successful that'l/zer transferred her affec tions to him almost at once. Sam was,,how ever, so severely beaten later on by a gang of young roughs organised by Biily Ohope from the Causeway (Sam was a Brady'e laner), and there was so little chance of bis recovery before a certain bank holiday, that Lizer began to cool towards him rapidly.,. A plu*h hat finally settled the question in Billy'B favour :—: — Liz-runt wa» linje ing hereabouts [a milli ner's shop] one evening when some one took hec by the waisfc and said, ""Wh/ch dyer like, Lizsr ? — the yeller un ? "" Lizeruat turned and ■aw th*t it wae Billy. She pulled herself avray and baited off, sullen and distrustful. 4< Gam,"" she said. "" Straight,"" said Billy, "" I'll sport yer one. No kid, I will."" "" Gam,"" said Lizerunt once more. "" Wot yer gittin at now ? "" But she soon was led to believe that "" bashing wasn't in it "" (she bad been bashed by the young ruffian before), and went borne triumphantly with, a red plush hat and blue feather. And*""Bhortly after the was married to Billy by a redtor wtfo set aside a free day for weddings, and encouraged early marriages on principle. Life with Billy and bis mother — who, like Lizerunt herself, was good of her kind — could not have been""nappy, but Lizer nnt was not specially unhappy. Some of tho scenes that occurred aro too painfully realistic to set out in full. Billy sponged upon both tbe women, even to robbing bis mother of the few shillings she had been saving for hor funeral. Wben I/.zarunt wa* faint and ill after tbe birth of ber child Billy would have bad ber up to ""get bis dinner"" but that the medical student in attendance, happening to come at the moment, kicked him out of bis own hou«e, which humane action Lizerunt faintly mad the mother noisily resented. In time the mother died, tbe pickle factory was closed to Lizerunt, and poverty, misery, and a family grew apaoe, so that Billy could screw no more sbilliogs oat of bis wife. Here is the end : — J It was more than Billy oould bear. "" 'Ere,"" he B*id one pighb, "" I've 'ad enough o' this. You go an' git some money ; go on."" ""Gj an' gift it ?"" .replied Ltesr. "" O yus ; tbaf 8 easy, aiu'b it. 'Go an' git it,' says yon. 'Ow?"" ""Any 'ow; I don' care. Go on."" "" Wy,"" replied LUter, looking up with wide eyes, "" d'ye think I can go an' pick it up in the street?"" "" Course you can. Plenty others doss, don't they?"" ""Gawd, Billy. . . . Wot d'ye mean ?"" There was a scuffle in tbe dark passage, with certain blows, a few broken words, and a sobf Then the door slammed, and Lizer Chope was in the windy street. Ou« T»le of A Menu Street. la ""That Brute Simmons "" Mr Morrison has, as we have said, given usa study which, though still sombre enough, is of lighter hue than the other, and with a tonch of humour in it. The "" infamous "" conduct of Simmons to his wife (he suddenly left her without rhyme or reason) was the scandal of the particular mean street in which the couple lived. Mr Morrison lets the reader into /the secret. Simmons was a carpenter, and married a childless widow— a Mrs Ford— who is the heroine of the tale. Years before, Ford had shipped as donkeyman on a. tramp steamer which had foundered with all hands at the Gipe. A few lines describes his successor Simmons :—: — He wm a meek and quiet man T with a boyish Saee and sparse, limp whiskers. He had no vices («vtn hio pipe departtd after bis marriage), and Mra Simmons had engrafted on him divers exotic virtues. He went solemnly to chapel everj Sunday and put a peuny in the plate. Then, Mra Simmons overseeing, he took off his best clobuea and brushed them with solicitude wad pains. On Sivtanlas aftonnoons he cleaned the knives, the forks, the boats, th« kettles, and the windows patiently and con scientiously. On Tuesday evenings he took fche clothes to the mangling; and on Saturday nights ho attended Mrs Simmons in her market ing to carry the parcels. The virtues of Mrs Simmons are as briefly described : — She was a wonderful manager. Every penny of Tommy's 36s pr 38s a week was bestowed to the greatest advantage, and Tommy never ventured to guess h«w much, of it she saved. Her cleanliness in hoasewirery was distracting to behold. She met Simmons at the front door whenever he cam* home, and then and th*r« he changed bis boots for slippers, balancing him self painfully on alternate feet on the cold flags. . . . She vigilantly supervised her hutband all through the process of "" cleaning himself ""after work. When thß denouement of the story comes, Mrs Simmons had taken to making her huu band's clothes and cutting his hair — much to his discomfort, both from the manner in which the work was done and (what weighed more on his mind) the chaffing he got from his neighbours. It was a warm summer night when the end came, and Mrs Simmons was out shopping, the husband being alone in the house, Blung into thoughts of rebellion by the sfght of a new pair of home-made trousers hanging by the wall. Here he observed the front door was open, and went hastily to shut it in f«ar of bis wife's return, for she thought it low to have the front door open. For a moment he looked into the street : — A Man was loitering on the pavement and paying curiously aboub the door. His face was tanned, his hand » were deep in the pockets of his unbraced blue troupers, and wtll bicVou his hbad he wore the high-crowned petked hat topped with «• knot of wool which is affected by Jack ashore about .the docks. He lurched a step nearer to the door and, "" Mrs Ford ain'6 in, Mshei"" 1 be »*id. ""Eh?"" '•Mrs Ford as was then— Simmons now, ain'c it ? "" Ho said *hts with' a furtive lear that Simmon* neithnr liked nor understood. "" No,"" »»id Simmoua, ""she aiu'o in uo/f. "" You ain't her husband, me je ? "" ""Yua."" The man took hie pipe from his mouth W># grraned silently and long. ""Blimy,"" he said at length, ""you look the sort of bloke she'd like,"" and with that he-grinned again. It was when the )new-comer had forced himself into the house that he "" infcerdooced himself in a manner of speaking "" :— •« I'm Bob Ford,"" he said ; ""come back out o' Kingdom come, so to say. Me as went down with Iho Mooltau— safe dead five year gone. I come to see my wife."" He had not come fco see his wife— on the contrary., be was nervously anxious to avoid; her-: - . ' ""•Well,"" said Ford suddenly (this af tersome: preliminary conversation), *"" time's short, «nd thisain't business. I won't be 'aid on you, matey. I ought prop'ly to stand on my rights, butseeia' as your a well-meanin' young man, so to epeak; an' all settled an 7 a-livin' 'ere quiet 1 * an,' matrimonnaU I'll ""—this with, a burafc. of generosity— ""damme, yus, I'll compound the felony, au' take me 'ook. Corce, I'll name a> figure as mau to man* fust an' laat, no less and mo mora. Five pouna»does it."" Simmons hadn't £s— he hudu't even 5d — and: he said'so. "" Ata' I wouldn't think for to come 1 between a man •n'°iswife,"" he added, '• not on, no account! It m»y be rough on< mx, but it's a> dooty. ril '6bfc it."" It was in. vain Ford reduced- his price to: ""one quid."" — the simple Simmons was nots going to lose his chance of escape, nor was 1 Eord going to remain. A rap at the door; announced the return of Mrs Simmons; Mr Simmons rushed tiatless pafft her into the street, saying, someone wanted to see her in' the. hotise. Bat by the time she came in. '. Ford, withont being seen at all, disappeared < by, the window. "" And that,"" adds Mn Morrison, "" is why Simmons's base. desertion .. — under his wife'B very eyes, too— is still am astonishment tw the neighbours."" The, fault of this, powerful book lies in the faot-tbat th« author has an eye — though a marvellously; keen one — only for the morally mean- and sordid.

296,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,223,SCIENCE NOTES.,"• . • New economies suggest themselves quickly in thsse days, and one of the latest to crop tip on the surface is the construction of railway bridges out of old rail. The Bal timore and Ohio road has two of these structures built out of scrap such as accu mulates in the atock of any line. The old rails were valued at 9 30l 50c a ton. The ar.gles from which the hargers were made were of short lengths that were spliced at their centres. All gusset plates were cut out of old web plates which had been purched for other purposes. The two bridges were constructed in the repair shops of the company, and required but the simplest tools in their manufacture. The advantage of this cuiioua innovation is that the old rails, which are always on hand, can be utilised, and the cash outlay is so 6mall on the whole job that the total cost is brought well within tho pi ice at which the cheapest wooden bridges can safely be built. • . • Electric motors have been applied in catting gems at a workshop in Los Angeles, California. The stone is fixed in a frame, which is pressed against the "" lap "" or grinder, and the fiiction cuts the gem as in ordinary diamond cutting ; bat tfea ar*rjj""*M liv. vi i-.lc nic power i« tuxht to be au i>g provement, as io is so easily controlled by the lapidi.ry. We may add that diamonds are now engraved after the secret process of M. Bordicckx, of Antwerp, which has been transmitted to bis son. A French scientific journal recently gave an illustration of jewels containing these worked and en graved diamonds, which may now be seen sparkling in jewellers' shops of the Boule vards, Paris. One is a scarfpin in the form of a yataghan, the head being a thin diamond and the handle a ruby; another is a pin having a pansy engraved on the gem ; another is a pin mounted with a knite of two diamonds ; while others are a pin carry ing a tiny bicycle with diamond wheels ; a pin having a diamond carved like a fish ; and broccbes in the shape of bees, cut in diamonds. ■ , ■ Animals are like the bright and fra grant fiawers of plants — when their function is accomplished they wither and perish. The business of the animal seems to be, not to live its own life, but to reproduce its own kind, and the term of life at its disposal is adjusted accurately to the special difficulties of this purpose. Death comes as soon as possible after the due number of successors has been produced, in order that each species may always be represented by a full tale of young and vigorous individuals. Natural selection acts like a contractor who has undertaken to keep a window box gay with freah blossoms — each plant mast be removed almost before its flowers fade. ■ . ■ Loss of sleep, in some of the lower animals at least, has been shown by expe riments of Marie de Manacsine to be more difficult to endure than starvation. Dogs that have been starved more than 20 days and have lost more than 50 per cent, in weight may recover, but to dogs of two to four months of age loss of sleep for four to five days proved fatal. The temperature of the Bleepless animals fell as much as 14r!eg, and food was refused during the last two days. • . • Dr C. Hart Merriam, an American naturalist, has made a fctudy of the distribn tion of animal and vegetable life, and finds that it is chi«fly governed by temperature. The northward distribution of species is apparently restricted' by the total quantity ot sunshine, or rather heat, which they re ceive during the period of their growth and reproduction. The southward distribution, on the other hand, is not governed by this condition, but by the mean temperature during the hottest part of the year — in other words, by the maximum of heat to which they ara exposed for a time. In some dis tricts of the Pacific Slope of North America, an anomalous intermingling of northern and southern tjpes of plants and atimals has been observed, and according to Dr Merriam this is explicable by the foregoing considera tion, inasmuch as there is a high total of sunshine in these parts combined with a comparatively low summer temperature. Obviously persons who cannot endure ex tremes of heat and cold, but require a great deal of sunshine throughout the year, might find a suitable climate on the Pacific coast. • . • Who would think of making sugar Bweoter by the addition of salt 7 Such, however, is asserted to be the case by a well known professor. Prom his experiments be finds that if to a solution of sugar there be added a slight amount of salt and water so weak that it excites no saline taste, the re sult is extra sweetening of the sugared water. The weakest of quinine eolation is said also to produce a practically similar result. The explanation given of the above seeming incongruity is that the ever-so feeble Baltness or bitterness imparts an in creased sensibility to the sensation of taste, and becce an appresiation of additional sweetness. • . • Dr Bertillon, the inventor of the an thropometrical syßtem, asserts that he haß discovered a new process for identifying handwriting. It is based on the measure ments of beatings of the pulse, which are Baid to have in every one a different and characteristic effect on handwriting. • . • M Meillire, of Paris, has published the formula of a cheap and efficient disinfectant, which is intended moia e*°ecially for use & i he bick room. It Cvm&iats of. 1000 grammes of zi.ac sulphate, 5 to 10 centigrammes of sulphuric acid, 2 centigrammes of ecsenoe of 'mirbane, and 15 centigrammes of colouring matter such as indigo. A small quantity of this mixture will not onlyaot as a perfect antiseptic, but it will replace objectionable odours by an agreeable smell. • . • Acetylene, the most powerful illumi nant of the hydrocarbons, can cow be pro duced on a commercial scale, says Professor Lewes in a paper read before the Society of Arts. It is a oolourloss gas, with an intensely penetrating smell resemblirg garlio, so that the smallest leakage would be quickly de tected. Five cubic feet of gas will give a light equal to 240 candles for an hour. It is made by mixing 40 parts by weight of finely ground chalk or lime with 24 parts by weight of any form of powdered carbon in an eleo tric furnace, and adding water. Tho product is lime and chalcic carbide, a pound of which will yield 53 cubic feet of acetylene. The carbide can be made for 20.30 l a ton ; the gas would cost about Idol GOo a thousand feet, but'its illuminating powsr would make its cost about equal to coal gas at 12c a thou sand feet. • . ■ To the sceptical it has been a matter for reproach, to the pious a matter for rejoic ing, that science has failed to solve the initial mystery of life. Both sceptical and pious might with profit have listened to Professor Bay Lankestor at the London Royal Institu tion recently, when he expounded the steps which have been made during the last 30 years towards that consummation. The in vestigations of Kowalewski into the develop ment of embryos have done much to bridge the apparent gulf between the vertebrate and the invertebrate; and onco we are down among the invertebrate, evolution carries as at a furious pace right back to the protozoon, whose single cell of proto plasm offers far less difficulty to the seeker after causes than does the rich and varied creation which has arisen out of it. The genealogical tree of life is by no means so stunted or barren as is generally supposed. Parallel researches all along the line of biological science have filled up an amazing nnmber of gaps, so that whereas half a cen tary ,*»go the discovery of bird-like lizards or geese with teeth would have been looked on as astounding anomalies, now they simply take their place as links iv au orderly fjstem of progression. — "" D^n't you feel afraid to let your wife drive that horoe 1 "" Husband : "" No, not now ; all the people know how to dodge out of her way.""",0,-2.092123781,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macdonald, Rsq., Mayor of Thames, for his untiring offorts in bringing about a good understanding botwoen the various local bodies at the Thames, and for tho impartiality and courtesy ho has shown in conducting this vexed and long-standing source of disunion to a successful and amicablo issue, which was consummated to-day by tho cheques for tho amounts awarded by tho arbitrators being paid by tho Council."" Tho adoption of the report was movod by Mr D. G. MacDonnell, who, in tho course of his remarks, passed a high eulo gium upon the delegates, Mossrs Brodio, Miller, and Bagnall, to whom he moved tho best thanks of the Highway Boards should be accorded. —Mr Stilwell seconded the motion, which was unani mously agreed to.—Tlio Chairman re sponded, and in the course of his remarks paid a high compliment to Mr J. A, Miller for the skill, ability, and legal knowledge which he had brought to bear on this subject. The following resolution was then movod by Mr Scott, seconded by Mr Miller, and, after some discussion, unanimously adop ted:—"" That the thanks of tho Boards be awarded to Messrs E. W, Hollis and J. H. Salmon for their ability and judgment as displayed in tho matter of the water supply arbitration; and that in the opinion of the Boards, the feo charged is not more than an adequate remuneration to the arbitrators for the time, attention, aud skill which they must have devoted to the business."" Mr Bagnall then movod, ""Thatin the opinion of this meetiug, the mombers of the Domestic Water Supply Committee should, if possible, get a bill passed this session for vesting the management of the water supply in accordance with the lerms of tho award, and, if necessary, to provide for tho diversion of the Waikeihei Oroek. The motion was seconded by Mr War< Loll, and carried. The Ohairman intimated that, as they wore met together, it would bo desirable that they should tako questions affecting tho welfare of the district generally into consideration, and suggested the desirability of having a member to repre sent the Thames in the Legislative Council, and after some discussion Mr Bagnall proposed "" That, in the opinion of this meeting, the Thames district should be represented in tho Legislative Council,"" and desired their Chairman to communicate with their members in the House of Assembly on the subject. Mr Scott seconded the motion, which was carried. The position of tho highway districts in regard to the cemeteries was then considered, and after some discussion it was proposed by Mr Miller, and seconded by Mr Stilwell, ""That the Boards agree to contribute their proportion of the debt due by tho Cemetery Committee in the same proportion as hitborto."" The desirability of having the boun daries of tho highway districts was also discussed, in view of the provisions whioh were to be mado regarding comity boards, and also in order to have reference mado to the subject at the forthcoming meet ings of ratepayers in each district; and, on the motion of Mr Scott, seconded by Mr_ Stilwell, it was agreed that it was desirable that the boundaries of the high way distriots should be exteuded. t A long discussion ensued on the ques tion of the advisability of constituting the peninsula into a county, but it was agreed to allow the question to stand over until suoh time as the members had tho County Bill before them. The provisions of the financial State ment of the Premier in referenco to the goldfields revenue was discussed, and it was agreed that if that portion of the Statement was carried out, it would be better for the Highway Boards than tho provisions promised in the Abolition Bill.

269,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,196,Chapter IV.,""" I see you have news for me,"" said the lawyer as he swung round in his office chair and looied full in his visitor's face, the lights being bo arranged that he himself was in shadow. ""Yea,"" said Saxon slowly as he paused with one band on the desk, "" I think I have, but I'm not sure."" "" Sit dowD, there's a good fellow, and tell me all yon know or suspect."" The printer obeyed, laying his hat be side him with a carious attention to detail which seemed as if it were done to gain time. "" Well ? "" said the lawyer interroga tively. "" I don't know where to begin."" ""Begin at the beginning ; I'm in no hurry, and I Bee that you are not. Left the office?"" "" For the present. I could not work, and made absurd mistakes. The boss was very good about it; he put another man on my frame, and promised to take me back when ever I wished."" "" That is well. You'll be able to help me in this matter. You're a bit of a detective, and may go about and use your eyes a little without being suspected. Our local men are too well known — as well S6nd a wolf to examine the condition of a sheepfold. The creatures would take fright immediately."" Saxon smiled in an absent manner, as if be were still thinking out the question that had before troubled him. The lawyer took up a file of letters and apparently occupied himself with them, the while covertly watching his visitor. ""It if so little to tell,"" said Saxon, "" and yet it may mean so muoh."" "" Go right on."" ""I went to see Mrs Burns and.Sasan last night. Have you Been them 1 "" The lawyer nodded affirmatively. ""Their manner was very strange— it seemed as if they were offended with me ; and not only that— which is perhaps natural — but they seemed to have no idea of Lil's real danger."" "" Yes, that atraok me too. Bat remember, the mother is prematurely aged, mind and body, and the daughter Is a cripple who can rarely g«t out, and sees few visitori. 1 ' •• But Susan can read. If she has read the daily papsrs she must know her sister's ter rible danger, even if no one has told her. Of course I know that the people most nearly ooncerned in any matter are the last to hear of it from outsiders, but this seems an exag gerated fgoorar.ee."" "" How then do you account for it, for I see that you have some theory 2 "" 11 1 believe that they are being purposely kept in the dark by someone who has his own evil ends to serve."" "" What an extraordinary idea 1 Your reasons."" 11 You must take them for what they are worth. To ma they are very convincing. When I went last night they were not only ill-pleased to see mo, bat. thoy were expect ing someone else — someone whom they did not wish me to meet. So they hurried me away without a civil word, and kept him waiting outside till I had gone."" "" Humph I a little suspicious, csrtainly,"" 11 Nor is that all,"" oontinued Saxon, warm? ing to his subject as ho saw that he had roused the lawyer's attention, and that he was willing to give the matter due oon sideration. "" Wheu I got to the garden gate — you remember it is exactly in iront of the cottage 2"" "" I remember."" "" When I got there I locked back. , I saw the door open and quickly shut, though I beard no sound, and the shadow of a man's figure passed in front of the blind — they had forgotten to move the lamp. . The figure im mediately struck me as familiar ; it was tall and thin and had a peculiar stoop from the shoulders."" ""Ah 1 "" breathed the lawyer, settling him self in his chair. "" Did not I Bay that yon were a born detective ? "" "" I waited in the road till he came out — X did not dare to remain in the garden lest they should look through the window and recognise me. He waa there a whole hour. When he cams out I noticed that he shut the door in the same stealthy way, and when he walked down tbo path his footsteps made no noise— he had on felt or rubber shoes."" "" And a light great-coat ? "" Saxon shook his head. "" No ; something dark— tweed or serge. There is a tree near the gate. I stood in the shadow. He passed me quickly. Just the same height, just the same stoop, just the same slouched hat covering the features, and just the same noiseless footstep — I could nob bo mistaken in these things. It is the man who came oat of Levi's 'shop on the night of the murder."" "" Did you follow him 1 "" ""Of course I did. It is a quiet street, and I did not dare to get too close lest I should arouse his suspicions. I crossed to the other side and walked on, affecting not to see him. When he walked quickly, l walked quickly, when he walked felowly I stopped and pre tended to enter some gate, and then caught him up again. -At last be began to get sus picious. He doubled back on bis steps and went up a narrow street leading into Hark ness street. There are no lamps in this street, and I had to keep pretty near lee 1 1 should lose him. In Hartness street I crossed to the other Bide, for it is wide and well lighted by shops as well as lamps, and I could see him easily. He Btopped in front of a tobacconist* and looked keenly up and down. I drew back into the shadow. Then he darted down a narrow right-of-way beside the shop. I followed quickly, and just caught a glimpie of his dark figure as he glided through a door at the bottom. I thought it was the door of a house ; I found afterwards that ifc belonged to a rough carpenter's shop or timber yard, the dwelling rooms being above and on one side, and that the owner allows people to take a short cut that way through hia yard to Ross street. I waited for some time, thinking that my man would come out again. Finding that he did not, I knocked, and receiving no answer I tried the door. It opened on the latch, and I found it to be as I have told you. My man had escaped."" The lawyer drew a deep breath. ""It is a queer story,"" he said ; "" but after all you may be mistaken."" "" I may be, but I think not. However, I shall soon know."" "" How 1 "" "" If it is as I suspect, and he is using aoma influence to keep the knowledge of Lilian's danger from her mother and Susio, he will not dare to leave them long to themselves— he will return, and I shall watch the house and communicate at once with the police; < but at present I do not want them to know what I have told you. As you say, they are too well known, they talk too much ; they would scare our shy bird. After a time, if he hears and sees nothing suspicious, he will begin to think that the shadowing was a mistake, that lie was not really followed; then he will go about as usual, and we uhall catch him."" "" Good, very good ! I will leave It in youi hands for the present, at any rate. And now I also have news for you. What do you think of an application from Lev! Jones's heir-at-law 1 "" ""His heir-at-law 1 I thought he had no relations."" ""So did I, so did everyone ; but it seems that he married on the goldfields 30 years ago ; that his wife left him with another ; that he discarded her, and passed as a bachelor. Now a man who purports to be his son, bom in lawfnl wedlock, writeß from Melbourne by his lawyer to claim the property."" Saxon suddenly slapped his thigh. ""By heaven I"" he cried, ""that makes things clearer."" ""How 2"" "" Don't you see 2 — it supplies a motive— a motive for killing the old man and perhaps dividing the spoil. Until this moment X conld not see any object, anything that was to be gained ; but now "" ""By Jove I Saxon,"" cried the lawyer enthusiastically, M you are a clever fellow ; you see these things far quicker than I do. Your talents are wasted in a printing office.'' ""It Is. not that; It is because I take such a kean interest in this particular case. I try to put myself in c eh one's place} to think as ha thinks} to see as he sees; to efface myself altogether; and then the first thing that strikes me is an absence of motive. I can understand the commission of any crime given an adequate temptation, but I oannot understand an objectless crime. Some pr~ ; -sd, or lost, or hate, or vengeance must be toe motlYO .tower, Given that— & sufficiently. strong temptation and weak powers of resis tance — and the rest is explicable enough."" ""And the girl?"" ""In her case there was absolutely no motive. Nothing to gain and everything to Jose — a comfortable situation, a kind master, good wages, plenty of leisure. Moreover she could not have done it ; it was against her nature. She would not willingly hurt a fly."" "" And yet you yourself saw her with the knife in her hand, and she told you that she had done it."" "" But for all that ifc waß not true. There are *ome things that certain people could never do. That is one. She could not have done it."" "" So I think, but we must prove it."" *' So we will,"" said Saxon confidently. "" Have, you any scheme, any suggestion to make?"" "" None at present. I want to think over this new development. May Igo away now and return to-morrow ? "" ""By all means. You have done well so far."" 11 1 hope to do still better. I have an idea, but I must be alone to think it out. Do you know Dr Li&tou ? Can you give me a note of introduction to him 1 "" •' Certainly I can. He was the doctor who examined Jones, and gave evidence at the inquest."" "" Yes. He knows me by name I suppose, . but nothing more, and I want to enlist his sympathies."" ""That you will easily do. He is a gocd fellow ; but I'll give you his address and a letter of introduction into the bargain."" ""A thousand thanks. I wish to ask him a few questions, the answers to which may fed of the greatest importance."" "" And you won't tell me what they are ? "" "" I would rather not at present — indeed, I scarcely know myself."" ""AH right. You are mysterious, but I'll try to bottle up my curiosity. Look at tbe morning paper for five minutes while I write to Liston, and then you can go and deliver tbe letter as soon as you like. By the way, be thinks as you do that the girl could not have committed the crime, though she may have had a guilty knowledge."" Saxon shook his head. ""That, too, is impossible,"" he said de cidedly. An hoar later Colin Saxon and Lesley Lls ton oame out or the latter's Bnigery. They were still talking earnestly, and the former had his arms fall of books. "" You think it is possible ? "" said Colin. ""Possible, but very unlikely. Modern science acknowledges the possibility of many thirg* which are in the highest degree im probable."" "" Nothing can be more improbable than that a young woman like Lil should com mit such a crime. It is simply incredible — people's characters do not change like that."" ""Perhaps you are not the best judge of her character."" ' "" I know it as no one else does. So far as any human being can be pure and guile less, she is. She is like her name — a spotless lily."" ""God help her then, for she is in sore Btraits."" "" Amen,"" said Saxon, and he bent his head as in church one bends before the benedic tion. "" God help her and help me to prove her innocence I "" {To be continued.)",0,-2.143735298,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,10,CRICKET.,"TOKOMATBIRO V. THE AIBIOH (DoNEDIN.) (From Our Own Special Reporter.) The return match between the. Albion and Tokomairiro clubs was played on the Dune din club's ground on Friday last, and resulted in an easy victory for our team. The game was commenced a little after noon, Tokomairiro taking the field in consequence of the whole number of the Albion not being on the ground. Cohen and Hutchison went to the wickets to face the bowling of Cook and Twiss. The former in his first ball sent Cohen to the right about, and almost imme diately afterwards displaced Hutchins\>n's timbers with a capital ball. Thus two wickets fell for no runs. Goudie and Payton next went to the wickets, but both fell vie tiais to Twiss's teasing slows, without adding much to the score. Of those who followed Little and Wells, the former with 9 and the the latter with 12 and not out, were the only ones who made scores. The Albion's first innings concluded for 34 runs."" For Tokomairiro, Simmons and Evatt were the first to go to the wickets, to the bowling of Cohen and Sherwin. Evatt got a few runs by careful play, and was then run out ; he was succeeded by Twiss, who was 1 clean bowled by Cohen for 0. iVlarryatt was the next to appear, but in playing a ball from Cohen, he hit into his wicketa. M'lntyre then joined Simmons ; and he started the running in fine style. He got twos and threes just as fast as they could be got ; and he had ruu up a prettj- tidy score before Simmons was bowled by Sherwin. The latter was at the wickets for a great length of time, but only made 6 Lane who suc ceeded him played very carefully indeed, and after getting his half-dozen was clean bowled by Cohen. MTutyre who in the meantime, had been doing just what he pleased with the bowling, was given out by his own Umpire, in attempting to run a double — a decision that to some seemed to be entirely wrong ; whilst by others it was contended that the ball on being returned struck the wickets. Cook, who followed, got hi 3 seven very quickly and was run out through "" skylarking."" Sturrock was also run out for 5 ; and Gregory made a double figure by good hitting. Tokomairiro's iinings concluded for 89 runs, of which number. 1 1 were extras. The Albion went in for their second innings a little before four, sending in Cohen and Hutchison. The latter was again clean bowled by Cook for a ""ducks egg"" and Cohen got 4, before a rattling ball from Cook lowered his off wicket. Goudie who followed also managed to get 4 before he was sent to the ris<hfc about by Cook. The ill-luck which attended the Albion in their first innings attended them in their second, for, with exception of Hutchinson Little and Payton. none of the others were able to make a stand. The two first mentioned played very carefully and drew up the score to something like a re spectable figure. Hutchinson was nicely bowled by Gregory, after having made 16, and Little got 9. The Albion's second innings concluded for 47 runs ; Tokomairiro thus winning in one innings with 8 runs to spara. Mr Uendley acted as Umpire for the Albiou, and Mr Lowis for Tokomairiro. The former gentleman provided a capital wicket, although the rain of the previous day made the ground rather dead. Twiss in the first innings was very destructive, more so we fancy than he should have been ; but in the second he was fairly collared. Cook was in splendid form ; and bowled dead throughout the game. We have been informed that the Albion team was very weak, in con sequence of the absence of Shepherd their best bowler, and two of their best fieldsmen. The following are the scores : — ALBION. — FIRST INNINGS.

The toasts of •'Success to all Cricketers,"" and "" Prosperity to the Albionr and Tokomairiro Clubs"" were then given, and received with enthusiasm. The evening's amusement was diversified by song 3 and speeches until a late hoar. r • On Saturday the Tokomairiro team played the fitst eleven of the Citizens C.C. The weather was most, miserable, and our men were so fatigued from their exertions of the previous day, that it was hardly to be ex pected that the result could have been other than it was. Some thought, very properly, that the match should not have been played under the circumstances ; and it is to be re gretted that that advice was not taken. Tokomairiro want to the wickets first, and obtained 49 runs ; of which number Gragory got 15, by careful play, and M'lntyre 11. The Citizens.- when the stumps were drawn, had obtained 59 runs ; Wills having got 39, and not out. He gave one or two chances in the early part of the match, but they were not taken advantage of. The bowling on the part of the Citizens, especially by West, was excellent. : Cook bowled capitally for Toko mairiro, considering that his hand was injured Gregory also bowled very well. The following were the names of the players— Tokomairiro — Cook, Evatt, Gregory, Lane, Little (subs), MTntyre, Marryatt, M'Fadyen, Poppelewell, Simmons and Twiss. Citizens — A rris, Clark, Ferguson, Morrison, Miller, Pledger, Wills, West, Oole, Gardener and Peake.",0,-2.169042368,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/bruce-herald/1870/01/19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

238,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,165,INTERCOLONIAL.,"Melbourne, July 31 Returns show that the amount expended in drink in Victoria last year amounted to L 3 759,000 or L 3 3 a per head of population. The Oounoil of Churches, aftei hearing various testimonies as to the effects of the working of the totalisator in Naw Zaaland and South Australia, has decided to petition both Houses of the Legislature against ltgilising the use of the machine in this colony. Toe Very Rev. Daan Gsoghegan, pioneer of the Catholic Church and sohool extension. The Age says that the expectation that the price of wheat in the world's market will continue to improve is inducing Victorian farmers to increase the cropping area, and this year considerably more wheat is being sown. , At the annual meeting of the Victorian Licensed Victaallera' Association, the report presented claimed that 80 members of the new Parliament supported local option, but were in favour of the payment of compen sation. August 1. The Union Fiour Milling Company, Hor sham, has suspended payment. About 60 farmers, whose wheat is stored, are involved to the extent of L 4600. The failure is said to be the result of overselling and having to repurchase stock in a' rising market. August 2. Two yoaDg men named Stalnsbury and Campbell have been arrested oa a charge of being connected with incendiary fires in Warrnambaol. They have confessed to the crime. August 4. In connection with the Abrahams' case, William Sawell, who was aotiDg as sheriff's custodian of the property, was arrested en a charge of stealing from the stock. When the case was called in the court, it was announced that he bad committed suicide that morning by shooting himself with a revolver. August 5. It is ecggeeted the missing ship Stone leJgh may have been wrecked near the Auck land Islaodß. The New Zealand Government will probably be communicated with on the subject. August 6. Six Warrnambool incendiarists have con fessed to starticg 16 fires, one of which caused a loss of LBOO. In several coses where the fire did not burn properly the men returned to the premises and re lighted it, and in order to prevent the possibility of the flames being extinguished in one case they locked the doors of the fire brigade station and threw the keys away. They üßed to hide until a crowd gathered, and then mix among them. Campbell, one of those arrested, was enrolled as a member of a vigilance committee formed to capture the incendiaries. He said they had no object in burning down the buildings, but had bean drinking, and were imbued with a spirit of devilment. SYDNEr, July 31. Advices have been received in Sydney that the French transport (Medonie, with 500 convicts for Noumea, left Colombo on July 10. The fire in the Broken Hill mine appears to be gradually subsiding. The smoke has greatly decreased, but it pours out inter mittently in large volumes. The fighting staff has been reduced, but everything is in readiness in case of a fresh outbreak. Work has been resumed on the adjoining blocks. With reference to the Hon. J. G. Ward's announcement that New Zealand intends to subsidise the Canadian -Pacific steamers, the New South Wales Postmaster-general states that New South Wales has heard nothing of the matter either from New Zsaland or Huddart-Parker. He points out that to call at New Zealand would lengthen the voyage by 36 hours. The Minister for Mines has received Lon don advices that the Westminster Vestry has decided to lay down 100,000 wood-paving' blocks. This is the first New South Wales timber used for the purpose. It is also stated that it is believed this will lead to the extensive use of blocks. News from Noumea indicates that a grow ing important trade between the New Hebrides and Sydney is causing considerable uneasiness in business circles in Noumea, and the local press is making strong efforts to divert the trade back to Noumea. At the annual meeting of the Cnamber of Commerce the chairman said there was every prospect of improved times, and the volume of trade was steadily increasing. Capitalists were showing more confidence. He made congratulatory references to tha rise in wool and wheat, which was apparently permanent, and thought that there were bright prospects before the meat export trade. After some discuseion the paragraph in the report to the effect that in view of the extreme Freetrade proposals of the Government the chamber had modified its views on Freetrade was struck out. A majority of members held that after fighting for Freetrade so lopg it would be impolitic to turn back just when about to secure perfect Freetrade. August 1. Two boys, named Wilson and Harrigo, have been arrested on a charge of being con cerned with Windon in stealing L 2500 worth of jewellery from Stewart Daweon and Oo.'s premises, The lads made a statement which will probably have an important bearing on the case. August 2. The fire at the Broken Hill mine is still smouldering steadily. On Thursday night the bottom of the open quarry showed a sub sidence of several feet, and the smoke has evidently reached the stoped ground below. The directors of the Broken Hill South Company have voted LSOO for the relief of the RaffereM by the late accident. The barqaentine Adelaide has arrived safely from the Thames. She encountered tempestnous weather and a sucoessidn of heavy head gales all the way. Kslly, who was arrested on a charge of poisoning a number of aboriginals at Fern mount by giving them a decoction which he believed to be rum, has been acquitted, The judge held that so far as intention went Kelly wm tzmoetafc, Carbonic acid gas is being pumped into the mine on fire at Broken Hill. Augu3t 4. Ciicket and Meagher, members of Parlia ment and counsel for the defence in the Doan case, are suing the Premier for L2OOO damages for alleged libel contained in a speech made at Newcastle referring to their connection with the case. At Broken Hill the mine floor of the quarry continues to settlo, and there is but littla diminution of the smoke. The carbonic acid gas has evidently had little effect yet. Carbonic acid gas is being introduced into the Broken Hill mine at the rate of seven and a-half million cubic feet per day. Bo far it has had no appreciable effect. The smoke is undimlnished, and the fire is now close to the richest ore supplies of -the great Proprie tary mine. If it continues to spread the supply of oxdised ore will be soon cut off, and great inconvoaionce caused. AU the men have been withdrawn since the carbonic acid gas was begun to be used. August 5. An aboriginal arrested at Wee Waa for a serious offence cut hit throat in the lock-up. Two native women came and saw the body, and departed wailing. Shortly after they, too, were found in camp with their throats cat. All three are dead. ■ Richards' store at Narrandera, New South Wales, hai been burned, the damage being over LIO.OOO. August 6. The fire in the Broken Hill mine is practi cally extinguished. A German trader named Ffeiffer has been murdered by the Aoba natives. The war ships Goldfinch and Scoiff are investigating the matter. Owing to the increase in traffic the Bail way Commissioners hare decided to again put the men in the Tailway shops on full time. For a considerable period a large number have been workicg on short time. The Shipwreck Relief Society's gold medal has been presented to Hareward H-)wison for saving his brother's life at Newcastle. Edward Sadler has been arrested in con nection with Stewart Dawson and Co.'s jewellery robbery, making the seventh arrest. Two of the missing rings were found in his possession. It is seated a confession made by Sadler will clear up the mystery of the robbery. Adelaide, July 31. Members of the South Australian Legis lative Council are indignant because at the recent State function the -President was racked after the ex-members of the Execu tive. Tho Council consider this dero gatory to the dignity of the chamber, and have adopted an address to the Governor asking him to obtain the opinion of the Colonial Office authorities on the question of precedence. August 4. Severe earthquake shocks have been felt in several places in the northern district* of South Australia. Houses and furniture 1 rocked, and at Bagot Hill a house was severely damaged. August 5. Lyon, the Wellington (S.A.) murderer, has died in the lunatic asylum. A serious labonr difficulty has arisen at Port Adelaide. The lumpers engaged on intercolonial steamers have struck against an attempt to alter the rate of wages paid for two hours' work on Saturday. Hitherto they received 3s, which is as much as tor two and a-half hours' on an ordinary day. The owners seek to make Saturday a quarter day of two and a-h»lf hours. The strike only affects Saturday work and is not likely to affect week days, but meanwhile the refusal to work steamers on Saturday is causing serious delay. August 6. At a large and enthusiastic public meeting at Adelaide, the Lieutenant-governor pre siding, the Australasian Federation . League of South Australia was formally inaugurated, and resolutions in f ivour of early Federation were carried. An old lady named Paecoe, who lives hero, is the successful claimant to estates in Cornwall which are in Chancery and are valued at two millions sterling.

The steamer Argus, which went ashore on a reef near Somerset, has been floated off with only a little damage, Auguet 5. There is an agitation amongst the Japanese residents of Thursday Island against a further influx of their own countrymen.

Wellington, Friday, LOCAL OPTION BIH, Tho House of Representatives resumed at 7.30 p.m. last night, taking up the debate on Mr Stout's local Option Licensing Bill. Mr Swanson announced that he would vote for a second reading, though he had no sympathy with the bill. Mr J, E. Brown eaid he would support a second reading so as to be able to pro pose.an amendment in committee in clause 13, to make the bill apply only to new applications for licenses. Mr Murray strongly supported the bill, saying the people.of England drank enough in five years to pay off the National Debt, and if there was prohibi tion to some extent in the colony it would effect a large improvement in the condi tion of the people and the revenue of the colony. * | Mr Macandrew moved the adjourn ment of the debate, so that they might learn what the publicans had to say against the bill in their petitions. MrWakefiold opposed the postpone ment. They had better, decide upon the principle of the bill at once, Mr Hunter seconded the fadjourn ment. A division was taken, and tho amend menfc was lost by 49 against 24. Mr Murray • Aynsley's amendment, that the bill be considered that day six months, was then put. Mr Lusk then made a strong appeal in defence of the Mil, urging that the bill was only carrying out the principle sanc tioned by the Bouse in 1873, but which through not having given machinery to carry that principle into effect was nothing but a fraud upon tho public at large. . Mr Wood opposed tho bill, : DEATH OF Dtt FEATHEBSTON. The Premier then read a telegram given him by Captain Holt, informin him of the death of Dr Fealherston, and said he was sure ho would only bo con sulting the feelings of tho Houso in moving its adjournment.

Before going into Oommitleo upon the Eating Bill, the Premier announced that the Government proposed that runs should be rated at one-half their esti mated value, in accordance with a plan arrived at after much discussion on the Highways Act, 1871. lie also said the Government proposed re-valuing the Canterbury runs, with a viow to offer them to the present holdors, they considered, in accordance with tho promises given, and tho understanding made. This was a fair mode of dealing with the question. The Government con sidered the circumstances in Otago widely different. In Cantorbury the tenure was much less substantial. Respecting the Otago runs, also, tho law specifically de clared that there should be discretion as to granting of how leases, and as to cutting up into smaller runs, and that all loascs must bo put up to public tender. The Promier also stated that when thoro was new power to rate, mining property would not bo exempt; A long discussion ensued, several goldfields representatives object ing to mining property being rated. There was great diversity of opinion as to general rating.

Amendments were proposed by Messrs Button and Stout. The latter, with tho viow of making tho clause apply to country dis tricts only, tho former to fix tho rateable value of any land at 5 per cent, upon its unimproved valuo at the time it was assessed. Other amendments were sug gested though not moved, and an ani mated disoussion was kept up till 5.30. OALIFOBNIAN MAIL BEBVICE, Further correspondence re the Califor nian mail service is published, Tho Sydney Government give no intimation of their views respecting changes in tho service, though asked to report on a modi fication, if any. The Postmaster-General has suggested to tho Sydney Government the appointment of a similar committee. COUNTIES Bill, The Counties Bill is just circulated. It contains 203 clauses.

In spoaking of the reasons for holding tho exhibition, lie s<iid there was the sentimeulal ono that it would be unworthy of .the colony when others wore celebrating their centennials not to murk in some substantial way the fiftieth anni versary of Us foundation, which would be on January 23rrf, 1890, and there could bo no batter wny of doing so Iht.n by an exhibition showing what the colonists had done in the past fifty years, and the resources they had to work upon during the next fifty. I hen there was the practical one, the great stimulus it would give to ir.dußtry. When times are im proving, and the markets are opening out, is the time to advertise, and the exhibition was intended to be an advertisement for the colony. It was desirable to restore confidence in the coiony among the colonists theeisalvoH, and confidence in the colony abroad. It was to be regretted that Neiv Zealand did not take more advantage* of the Col -ninl and iudkn Exhibition. The Victorian court at, that exhibition made « groat insp-iauon, and ha had no doubt [b:r that, imprest);; agisted very much iu producing the prosperity which Vi-ii.ciia had iiine;< enjoyed. New Z:ci.>ua l.ad been surely drugging ahead, biu the people at Jtiome did not know it, auJ consequently New Zealand failed to attract settlement, whilst Australia, though not nearly so wall fitted for it, had baon doing so. He Paid th« peoply of Dunedin had sub scribed £15,000 and the Government had promised £IO,OOO, but there were in quiries for epuco from abroad, which showed that the £25,000 would he all required for buildings, and there would be some £IO,OOO or £15,000 uioro needed for other expenses. What was wanted from each district was a good show of its products. A scale of charges for space had been adopted, but it was thought that it would be unreasonable to ask farmers and people who could not show for their own personal benefit to pay for space, and that the most reasonable course would be for local committees to take a whole bay or bays at a redncod price of £8 euch, the bays having 12 feet frontage and 12 feet id depth. They asiked the people of this district to take as many bays as might be Decessary ut that rate, and do all they could to make a good show of their resources. It was thought to be a good idea to arrange the exhibits geographically, so that a visitor cora- roenciog at one point might view in succession the products of the various districts, siy, from south to north, instead of having tliera all mingled or classed according to their nutura. E*ch district should have its locality indicated ou a map in its bayp, and clear information given by placards respecting the exhibits. In respect to wheat, for instance, there might bo a trophy, with n mark on the map showing where it was grown, a statement of the yield per acre, and photographs of the growing crops. Mr Twopenny in the course of his remarks said the commissioners had agents at Home and in Australia advancing in every way the coming exhibition aid he pointed out the good that tourists must rio the colony. Thsy might not settle, but the reports ihey took Homo must have a good effect. The Mayor, Mr W. Evans, and xMr Kinsey Ward, of Cliristchurch, mndr* a few raraarks. It was reaoived thnt the following be ft committee for the representation of the district at the exhibition, with power to add to their number :—Messrs Evans, Priest, H. 3. LeCren.F.

197,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,124,DUNEDIN PRESBYTERY.,"At Tuesday's meeting motion of condolence was passed to the relatives of the late Mr Edmund Smith. STHATH-TAIBHI. The Rev. J. M. M'Kbrrow reported that he had preached the Str&th-Taieri charge vacant, and that there was a very strong aversion on the part of the whole district to be reduced to the position of a church extension charge. It was agreed that the committee- be con tinued with the view of obtaining further information. BIBLE IN SCHOOLS. The Modbratob said that Dr Belcher had received from the secretary of the Scripture Text Books Association, Christchurob, » copy of a draft bill framed Tor presentation ' to Parliament, witli a view to having Scripture lessons in the public schools. Dr Beloher had forwarded the communication to the Rev. Mr Saundors, who was supposed to be tbe secretary of the committed appointed with regard to the matter by the joint churchf s of Dunedin. Mr Saunders thought I hat the Presbyterian Chutch was the only body in Dunedin; which would take the matter up, and he had sent it on to tho presbytery. The shortr title of the bill was "" The Scripture Text Books in Public Schools Bill 1895."" The term "" Scripture texb books"" meant tha ""Irish National School Book of Scripture Lestfons "" ; and the bill provided— ""That, notwithstanding anything to the con trary in • The Education Act 1887,' the lessons of the text book shall form, one of the subjects of instruction in all public sohools. The leuons in the Scripture text book shall be taught in every publio school on tho dayo on which the schools shall be opened, during the first 30 mioubea of the first school hour in the forenoon; and before such teaching the Lord's Prtyer may be said. No ohild shall be compelled to be present at the teaching of the lesson in the Scripture text book who c pareut3 or guardian shall intimate their objection thereto' in writing."" Tha Rev. W. Will t'cought the presbytery should heartily approve of this movement. Be would move — *' That the presbytery very cordially approve of the proposed bill, snd express a hope that it would be steadily parsed into law."" Tho Rev. R. R. M. Sutherland seconded the motion. Tho Rev. J. M. M'Kbbhow inquired if there were anything in the bill which would in any way tend towards denominatioaalixm. Re understood that there, were terms in the book which required explanation by the tsacher, and this bf-.ing so ib would leave the door open to denomiustionalism. The Rev. W. Will -said that thojieit answer to Mr M'Kerrow'a remarks was that the books were drawn up by the representatives of the Rom-ni Catholic, Episcopalian, and Presbyterian Churches in Ireland, and care was taken that no denomiua.' ionali-m should be taught. The.usa of the text book was to get such general teaching of the Bible as would embrace all denominations. , The suggestion was agreed to.Hhe motion was carried, and a committee app jintsd consisting of the moderator and the Rev. Messrs Suther land and Cameron. MISCELLANEOUS. On the motion of the Rev. A. Camebon, it was resolved to appoint MeesiM Botrie, Hewit son, Sutherland, Cameron, and Will to confer with leading office-bearers of the church, and be prepared to make suggestions aa to the best way of celebrating the jubilee of the church, and report at next meeting.

23,1889-04-09,TEML,Temuka Leader,24,SPARE THE HAWK.,"Unintelligent, thoughtless criticism is one of the weak points of agricul turists here as elsewhere. Experience even does not teach as it ought, because the taught will not observe and note results. In the United States this is a State duty, and is faithfully performed to the great advantage of all concerned, as may be inferred from the following extract from a country paper:— The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture for 1887, recently issued, includes a report of the Assistant Ornithologist of the Department, Dr A. K. Ksher, on the food of hawks and owls. This is based on the ex amination of 1072 stomachs of these rapacious birds, and will prove of special interest to farmers, In Massa chusetts, for instance, the three com monest large hawks are the marsh— usually seen flying low over meadows and marshes, and conspicuous for its white rump—and the red-tailed and the red-shouldered hawks. The two latter are most often noticed soaring high in air, and among people generally are known as "" hen hawks,"" implying that they prey upon poultry. Doctor Fisher and his associates examined the stomachs of 311 red-tailed hawks, with the following results:—2s contained poultry, 4 contained quail, 5 contained crows, 35 contained other birds (sparrows, etc.), 203 contained mice, 55 contained other mammals, and 24 contained insects. Of red-shouldered hawks 102 stomachs were examined. Out of this number only one con tained poultry, while 61 contained mice, 20 other mammals, and 40 con tained insects. No farmer ought to be long in deciding that such "" hen hawks "" as these are friends rather than enemies. Two hundred and three stomachs of the red-tailed hawks con tained 270 mice. Such efficient farm hands may surely bo spared a chicken or two now and thou.—Paso Eoblee Moon.",0,-2.253380302,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/temuka-leader/1889/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
295,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,222,PERSONAL NOTES.,"• . • Charlotte Bronte's huoband, the Rev. E. B. Nicholls, is still alive in tbe south of Ireland. He married again a few years after the death of his first wife. • . • In Asolo, north-west of Treviao, opposite the house where Robert Browning wrote "" Aso lando,"" Barrett Browning has established, in memory of his father, a lace school, where young girls are taught to weave the old patterns of Venetian lace. • . • The Duke of Northumberland, who has just been celebrating his eighty-fifth birth day, and surprising everyone by his wonderful vigour, is one of the very few survivors of the unreformed Parliament, having from 1831 to 1832 represented Beeralston. • . • Some people are surmising that Mr Rudyard Kipling will be received with a certain coolness in military circles when he revisits India, accompanied by his wife, next cold weather. It is supposed that the recent ballads in the Pall Mall Gazette have not been warmly appreciated by those who have to do with To ix my Atkins. • . • When Mrs S. O. Hall was at least 70 years old, she met at a reception a young olergyman, who was apparently delighted to see her. "" Mrs Hall,"" said he, "" I remember reading your books when I was a child, and that I was especially charmed by the Irish stories."" ""Then, sir,"" flashed Mrs Hall, ""if you read my books when you were a child you ought to know better than to say so ! "" • . • Mr Thomas Smith, the Surgeon-Extra ordinary to the Queen, is familiarly known at Bart's as •' Tom."" Born about 65 years ago, tall, with wavy, grey hair, moustache, and beard, the expression of his careworn face is exceedingly sad and doleful, and in this re spect belies his temperament. "" Tom ""is a bold operator, with good hands, a quick brain, and a pleasant, re-assuring manner. ' . * Bill Nye, the genial American humo rist, is, we well know, a man of very sober demeanour, and rarely cracks jokes outside newspaper columns. He has been known, however, to play a practical joke on a friend. John Fox, Jan., says that when Lieutenant Greeley started on his expedition to the North Pole, Nye gave him a sealed box that was not to be opened until he bad reached his farthest point north, It contained axle grease for the pole. • . • Lady Charlotte Scbrieber is the only woman in the world, exoept the Baroness Burdett-Ooutts,- who can boast, of being a free woman of a London city company. She owes this honour to the fan-maker^ for she is at the present time the great authority on ancient and modern, foreign and British, fans, and the splendid collection which she lately presented to the British Museum is visited by people from all parts of the world. • . • The Paris correspondent of Truth says :—"": — "" I hear that Lord Dufferin will cer tainly retire next year. lam very sorry. He takes most seriously all his Ambassadorial duties, and is in his personal relations simply exquis. Lord Dufferin had a difficult task, because when he came to Paris hatred to every thing English was thought the shortest way to the late Czar's heart. It so happened that both Czar and Czarina held him in parti cular regard. When this was discovered animosity ceased. He is greatly alive to the brilliant and amiable qualities of the French, and therefore took' to heart the attacks of which he was the object at the outset of his mission to the Ely see."" • . • Mr Cecil Rhodes's ways lie in pleasant places. At "" Groot Schuur "" he has a museum of Cape Dutch curios and 'Matabele relics such as none bat he could have pro cured. He has a glen carpeted with hydran geas, a portion of which is laid out in great violet banks, and blx miles of avenues commanding magnificent views. More than these, he has an immense preserve for "" big game,"" including the lions and fast-disap pearing antelopes in which South Afrioa used to abound. He has given the major of Cape town the right to distribute 2000 keys, admitting tbe holders to his grounds, be sides liberally dispensing similar privileges to his nearer neighbours. • . • Mr John Milne, on whom the Emperor of Japan, with Qugen Victoria's approval, has conferred the Order of the Rising San of the fourth class, is a Scotsman, who has for more than 20 years besn in the service o£ the Japanese Government, making researches into the nature and causes of earthquakes. He has been assisted by a staff of Japanese seismologists, and has made many valuable discoveries. His promotion to the Order o£ the Rising Sun seems to be meant as con solation for a calamity whioh recently befell him, when his obiervatory, instruments (mostly of his own invention), and papers were accidentally destroyed by fire. ' . ' The Rw. E Smirnoff recently read a paper entitled ""Philatete, the Metropolitan of Moscow,"" before the Anglo-Ruasian Literary Society at the Imperial Institute. The accomplished ecclesiastic, Philaiete, exercised a great influence on the destinies of Russia. To him Alexander I entrusted for safe custody the testamentary dosument which appointed Nicholas I, instead of his elder brother Conatautine, emperor of all tht Russias. It was'also Philaiete who put the fiuitthiog stroke to the. noble manifesto by which Alexander 11, braving the ire of the nobility, liberated the serfs. Father Eugene Smirnoff is the chaplain of the Ras«ian Embassy in LondoD, and is remarkable for his erudition and literary aptitudes. • . • The story of a very narrow escape is related by Captain Macfarlane, of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, who has ju«t re turned to Pindi. The gallant officer, who is in hospital suffering from bad gunthot wounds in his arm received during the storming of the Malakand Pass, relates that while the Borderers were forolng tbeir way up under a storm of shot, a man near him was hit heavily in the chest and fell to the ground. He ran to his assistance, and on opening his belts, which were half cut away by the shot, discovered the bullet burled in a Bible which the soldier had carried in his bosom, and thus saved bis life. The man bad been ill in hospital at Pindi some time before, and one of the nursing sisters had given him the Bible. ■ . ■ The new Russian Minister for Public Works, Prince Miohael Coilkoff, has led a romantio life. Ho began his career as a page at the Imperial Court. Later he re ceived an officer's appointment' in the Chas seurs of tho Guard, where b* led his com panions in the wildest dissipations In 1850 he left tbe army and entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but after a little time, find ing himself ruined, he disappeared, and emi grated to the United States, where he worked on the construction of one of tbe Western railways as a simple labourer. He soon grew dissatisfied with this, and went to Liverpool, where he learned the blacksmith's trade. Later he returned to Uussia, and was employed as a machinist on the railway to Ktew. Through the influence of some of his old friends, who had found him out by chance, he was again made an officer in the army, and accompanied Skobeleff on his ex pedition into Central Asia. Ho wai next heard of as Direotor of Public Works in Bul garia, and afterwards returned to St. Peters burg, where he was employed as Inspector general of Railways ; then he became a Councillor of State, and now is a Cabinet Minister. • . • As a worker of mechanical wonders doubtless Edison stands first, and what has attached a deal of marvellous effect to his work is that he deals in things hard to under stand and little known by more ordinary beings. His phonograph is still a wonder and a puzzle to the average non-mechanical mind. It cannot be grasped that the vibration of the diaphragm in the machine is only a reproduc tion of what takes place in our throat when sound is produced. The moat common im pression that the writer experiences from the uninitiated is that the breath is an active factor in voice production, and therefore a phonograph should be a kind of wind instru ment, or otherwise prove a failure. That the minute and rapid movements of the dia phragm of a phonograph should cause articulate sound is apparently difficult to understand. So it is with the telephone. It is quite believed that the feeble electric current through these wires conveys the actual sound. The fact of the vibrating effect of the voice sound making and breaking a rapid succes sion of electric currents by its action on the transmitting diaphragm, and so causing a corresponding set of vibrations on the re ceiving diaphragm at the other end, cannot be seen At all. Edison is clearly a genius of the highest order, and his successes make it possible to believe that we shall presently have what he has already hinted at, a means of seeing, as well as hearing, from great dis tances. This, however, would not bs an un mixed blessing if adapted to the telephone ; for frequently the messages are quite enough to bear, without a view of the sender. — English Mechanic.",0,-2.263724385,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

282,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,209,THEY OWN HALF THE KINGDOM.,"The largest landowner in Great Britain is that extremely fortunate young nobleman the Duke of Sutherland. The territorial possessions of this family comprise no less than 1,218,547 acres, of which 42,093 are in England, and 1,176,454 in Sutherlandshire. After the Dowager Duchess has been paid L 500,000, as agreed on last year, the Dake has left an income of L129.6G5 from his estates, to say nothing of 'the rentals he de rives from some 200,000 aores in Australia, and 425,000 in the United States. The let ting of his Scotch moors and deer forests yields a further L 29.000 a year, and fisheries L2OOO more. He has also the interest of L 301.000, the sum bis father expended when he constructed the Highland railway from Inverness to Golspie, baeides nearly L 500.000 worth of L. and N. W. R. stock. The family-seats number five, of which Dunrobin Castle, N. 8 .; Trentham Hall, Stafford, which was modernised in 1834 at a cost of LI 50,000 ; and Stafford House, London, which oosts L 20.000 a year to keep up, are the chief. The present Dake of BuccL-uch is blessed with 13 other titles, and 459,550 acres, pro ducing the oolossal revenue ot L 131.205, and when to this inoome is added LIO,OOO for the dues of Granton Dock, and L4OOO for minerals, it is surprising that the late Duke could only leave a trifle of L 902.316 behind him. The Duke of Norfolk 1b a gentleman who, if he chose, could spend L 269,698 a year without impoverishing himself. His income — excepting L 75 596, the rental of 49,866 acres, Bituated in eight counties — is derived from Sheffield, which city he practically owns. Some years since he sold the city markets to the corporation for L 267.000. . The E irl of Derby's posse&bious comprise 68,942 acres in five counties, worth L 163.273 a year, besides a huge property in and about Liverpool and Bury. In 1710 the then waste lands of Kirkdale and Bootle were purchased for L 12.000. A fortunate inve&tment this. Over L 300.000 has been paid by the corpora tion for strips of the forethore as duck exten sion became necessary, and the land in Kirk dale and Bootle is now let out at so much a foot. Ti>e total income at present is calcu lated to be close on L 300.000 a year. The Marquis of Breadalbane, who comes of the Bame stock as the A'gylls, is the only nobleman in tbe United Kt> g lorn who cm ride over 100 miles in a straight line without oDce leaving his own land. Ha owe fe 438 358 acres,* all in Scotland ; but as much ot it is worthless for agricultural purposes, it only brings him in LSB 292 per year, plus L 5300 more for shootiuga in Perth. Ta> mouth Castle, the chief of his four ves>idence3, is supposed to bo the finest seat in Scotland. The Duke of Richmond's name is so closely associated with his lovely place at Goodwood that few people are aware that bis Grace is alarge Scotch proprietor, owning, in addition to an extremely commodious residence, Gor don C«stle, some 268,000 acres, the rtveoue from whioh is L 60.705. When the Duke re members that his 17 117 acres about Good wood bring him in L 19.283, he probably laments his mao lu.y to tiausftr the pastoral fertility of Sussex to the rocky sterility of Banff. The Duke of Fife, according to many stories about him, is descended from the Macduff who slew the tyrant Macbeth. It is a pity to dispel so pleasing an illusion, but, as a matter of fact, the earliest anchor of this family was a Mr Alexander Duff, a worthy citizen of Keithmore. Still, ax the Duke has, or rather till lately had, 249 220 acrep, with a revenue of L 72 563 a year, he can afford to bear the assault on tbe anti quity of his ped'gree with resignation. If the Duke of Atbole's reut roll of L 42.020 is tot alls unworrhy of estates whioh extend over 201,640 actes, he has reason to be proud of the number of his titles, which exceed the Duke of Buccleuch's 14 by one. The At holes cut a rare dash in the early part of the century They then had the spending of some L618.0C0, received at various times from the Government as purchase money ot their rig 1 its and privileges a» lords of tbe Isle of Man. The Duke of Northumberland is"" another nobleman who, shrinking from the glare of notoriety, finds his compensation in adminis tering the affairs of a huge esrate of 18G 397 acres, situated in four English counties. Alnwick Castle, N> rthumWrland, is one of the most magnificent retire-noes in the king dom. The ducal income is large, L 176.048 ; but no one can deny that this family have made a noble use of their money. In the neighbourhood of the castle the follow ing sums bave been expended : — On roads and bridgHß, L 39 689; on drainage, L 176.583; churches, L 100.000; cottages for the tenantry, to the majority of which half aa acre of land is attached, L 308.33 6; and L 250.000 on beautifying Alnwick Castle. Ooe Duke planted a million trees at Sion House, I*leworth. The Duke of Portland's is another instance of a family who have expended vast sums on their estates. The late Duke conceived a hai red of mankind so great that to avoid the hateful necessity of coming in contact with any of Hern he burrowed under his park at WtMbeck with i-noh je>-i-.ienoy that after some years' work he completed a number of apartments, besides a riding school 400 ft long, 106 ft wide, and 50ft high, a ballroom, picture gallery, and a subterranean railway one mite and a-half long. This little hobby coat this eccentric nobleman over two mil lionß. It required a gigantic income to have survived such an expenditure .and this the last Duke possessed. His property consisted of 183,199 aores, and a rental of L 83.300, in addition to a huge London property in the neighbourhood of Portland place, the ground rents of which will presently pass to Lord Howard de Waldon ; and as this nobleman's present inoome is only LI3OO, he must regard the increasing value of this property with affectionate solicitude, especially ac, 6ince the leases have begun to fall in, the value is rapidly approaching L 200.000 a year. The preßent Duke of Devonshire is a strange man. His grandfather spent nearly L 1,500,000, 500,000 in creating what land auctioneers oall a terrestrial paradise, at Ohatswortb, and another L 250.000 in renovating his other six seats. Yet they have no attraction for the Unionist leader, who is never bo happy as when from the peers' gallery in the House of Commons he watches the progress of a struggle below. Should he ever ran short of money, a million would be quickly forth coming for Devonshire House and grounds, London. Bat this is not likely to happen, as the English estates comprise 138.536 acres in 11 counties, worth L 146.420 per annum ; and 60.036 aores in three Irish counties, worth L 34 330 per annum. Mere aoreage affords, however, no due to the rental. Lord Lovat is almost as large a landowner as the Duke of Devonshire, but bis 181,791 acres are only worth L 30.000 a year. -• Still a nice little sum can be saved out of even such an income as this. The Duke of Argyll has 175,114 acres, which produce an income of L 50.142, greatly mortgaged. Lord Macdonald has 132,419 acres, but he has to make both ends meet on Ll6 613 a year. The Duke of Montrose owns 103,347 acres, but he probably considers L.24,872 a small income for a duke. He would doubt less like to change places with the Earl of Cawdor, who extracts from his 101,657 acres an income of L44.G62 a year. Few Irish peers, even of high rank, are wealthy. The Marquis of Oonyngbam owns 156,973 acres, worth L 50.076 a year ; but his income would be L 17.432 a year less were it not for a Kentish estate of 9737 acres. The Marquis of Siigo's 114,881 acres only bring him L 19.000 a year. The Earl of Leconfiald is the owner of 43,834 acres of Irish laud, with an inoome of L 20.663 a year. His English estates of 66,101 acres are worth L 67.419. The Marquis of Downshire is the richest Irish peer/ His estates in that country total 114,621 acres, with a revenue of-L9l 522 a year.

In the votes for District, Magis trates', and Wardens' Courts a saving of £60 in ifche clerical department in the Duuedin, Outram, snd Port Chalmers district is effected. In 4he Prisons department the vote for gaoler at is nbolithed. The total priion vi.ta is £18,617, againtst £18,499 list year.

IHE GOVERNMENT LICENSING BILL. • The Premier's Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Bill of 39 clauses has been circulated. After Che oomiug into operation of the measure no licenses shall be granted or renewed until the eleotors of the district have determined on the following four questions : — (1} Whether the nnNQber of licenses existing in the district ia*o be continued ; (2) whether the number of licenses in tbe district is to be reduced ; (3) 'whether any licenses shall be granted in the t district ;■ (4) whether any licenses shall be granted in the colony. The poll is to be taken Jon the day of the general election, but different and ballotboxeaare to beused. Every voter can vote for either one or two of the questions. It is provided that theie must be a three-fifths 'majority of those voting in favour of local or colonial prohibition before it can be carried, and a tbree>fiftb.s majority it Kfdißite before a district .where prohibition hay been carried can carry the restoration of licenses. Should restoration be carried, the committee must grant not less than 50 per cent, if applied for, and not more than tha total number of licenses which were in existence prior to the enforcement of prohibi fcition. R*ilvr*y rt f re shmenfcrooms and clubs are to be made subject to the local option vote, and no club license can be granted for premises closed owing to reduction. Bottle licenses are to be abolished. In the event of colonial prohibition being carried all liquors landed in the colony are to be placed in the Quean's bond, and are not to be cold except to chemists for medicinal puxpotes, or for the purposes of manufac ture there. A clause in the bill provides that a bomajide traveller must have travelled five miles. The bill provides for severe penalties for sup plying female Maoris with liquor. As to Bellamy's, it is provided that on the first session of each new Parliament a poll shall be taken of members of both Houses as to whether liquor is to be sold within the precincts, and the votes o£ a majority shall decide the question. • --' ' ATTITUDE OF /THE ALLIANCE. The secretary of the New Zealand Alliance in forms me that from the point; of view of this body the-measure is very unsatisfactory. It is true, he Bays, that the provisions of the Government bill conceda in a great measure the principles for which the Alliance has contended, but theie con cessions in principle are made of no effect by .the manner in which the bill proposes to put them into operation. The machinery clauses are so constructed as to make them almost valueless from the prohibitionist point of view. The Alliance demand that the straight issue of ""license"" or ""no license"" should be placed before the elector*, and are prepared to aban don the reduction vote. The introduction of the reduction vote, tbe temperance people pom^end, timply splits op the votes of their people and plays into the hands of the publican party. The Temperance party intend to do their utmost to make Mr M'Nab's bill the law of the land, and if they fail in that they will direct their utmost endeavours to improve the Government bill, so as to make it as much as jmuible a measure after theie own hearts. JOTTINGS. Mining legislation . wilL probably be intro duced providing for keeping of more itrict plans and records of the underground working of mines with the view of preventing Accidents. Mr Carnell's .bill for tbe abolition of the totalisator provides that the machine shall ba deemed an instrument for gaming within the meaning of the gaming acts, and may be seized and destroyed by the police. Anyons having a totalisator on a racecourse or any public place, or keeping a house in which one sh*U be found, shall be liable to a penalty of £50, or imprison ment for six months.",0,-2.317926631,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,81,LAKE WANAKA.,"August 5 —The weather now shows evqry in dication of tho break up of the severe frost. Last Saturday week there was a lot of rain, but imme diately afterwards it froze as hard as ever. List •Saturday afternoon it rained a mild thawin? ram for a few hours, and it 8( emed to bring a lot of snow off the hill*, so that we are hopeful of no floods occurring in this district. ■ Probably by next week at lates 1 ; ploughiug will b3 in full swing. It Would be well for puichasaw and,con sumers to at once lay in a stock of oats an 1 oaten chaff, as the farmers will soon be too bir.y to cut or^deliver any when they will be trying to make up'for lost time. Up to the time of po-ting this letter a mild thiwiog wind is blowing. Ribbt ing operations have been almost suspended during the winter, bat possibly the hoJivy Know on the hills has killed large cumbers. They are not so plentiful here as in former years Then the wholesale migrations from Southland kept up the numbers, but no w that this has ceased to a great extant they seem less in number. Possibly pollaid poitoning may be universal in the spring in'ouler to kill any that are left. Linseed Growing — A Banks Peninsula corre spondent asks 'for particulars about 1 meed grow ing. I grew some here, and it did -very well. It looks ye y beau'iful while in flower. If r it is required for seed ouly, about 151b is sufficient seed for au acre, when a large number of branches will grow fiom one trunk. If required for lint, 801b to 501b to the acre will be requi ed, in which c»Ee the linseed must be pulled by hand. There is a lint factory at Temuka, and I was rouud there some years ago, but I wag unable to obtain any information from the manager. This i 3 quite contrary to all my «xperieuce«, before or since. Messrs Mills, Dick, end Co , J3unedin, sell the New Zealand Agriculturist for ss, and it contains valual Id information about all farm crops, in cluding linseed. Departing -Teachers. — A couple of departures of teachers from near Cromwell call for a little passing notice. Mr D. S Mason, the teacher at •Lowbuin, has left to take charge of the Walton Park School. Mr Mbbou's place will be almost impossible to fill, for he was one of the leading lights of the Bible Christian Church, and when the Rev. 'Mr dimming, of the Presbyterian Church, was away Mr Mason cccupied his pulpit. .In Mr Mason's private life he was a pattern to the rising generation and to everybody, and this is a very important item in a teacher's life. In fact, success often depends on their personal popularity. Needless to say, all Mr Mason's friends gathered round and wished him and Mrs Mason God-speed, and presented them with valuable and useful presents. — Miss C. G. Weir, who has had charge of the Tarras School during the past four years, has just left, being promoted to the position of mistress in the I'ortobello School. It was with much regret that Miss Weir left Tarras, seeiug -that the people, extended so many hindnes-e? to her, and they/presented her with a writing de>k »b showing the manner in whirth they appreciated her good qualities and genial manner. By the way, I once a<ked a youth for paiticulara of a banquet tendered to a departing lady teacher, and all the information that he was able to give was that ""they gave her a feed "" 1 Conceut and Ball.— The annual concert and fancy dress bill in aid of the Pembroke School funds duly took place in Mrs Russell's Hall on June 26. The concert was not so lengthy as on prfevious occasions, performers seeming to te icarcer now than formerly. The Misses Hed ditch and May Ilussell opened the concert with a musical selection. The school children, of which about 16 were girls, gave a couple of beautiful choruses ; Mr Newman, from Bindig.i, g*ve "" Father O'Flynn"" in his best style ; Mr ArSkim miog danced a sailor's hornpips and an Irish jig, Mr A. G. Thomson tang ""The Storm Fieud,"" and .Miss Sachtler gave a musical selection. Mis 3 Sachtler and. Mr ThO'i son divided the accompani ments. An inteival preceded the farce, ""Mr Pipkin and Family."" The performers acquitted themselves very ■well, and weie quiet equal in histrionic talent to any in the neighboyuiog centres. The complacent happiness of Mr Pipkin and the disdain of his ""wife and daughter were well -shown ; but it seemed to me that they were in too much of a hurry to get through with the piece, many a good laugh 'being nipped in the bud thereby. It is an art in itstlf to know when and where to pause for the laughs to come in. Mr Pipkin (Mr A. G. Thomson), a retired crockery merchant, bought a ruined houße and garden cheap, and was immenvely delighted in conse quence. Mrs Pipkin (Miss B .""■ a^htle?) and Miss Pipkin (Miss May Russell) expresi-ed conterr pt for the same. Mr John M 'D.iugall was the wander iite artist who told Mr Pipkin ghost stories. Miss Kdie Hedditch wan the housemaid. Mr Andrew M'Dougall was the yokc-1 in love with Susan, and jealous of Pipkin. Messrs Cockfield and Theo. Russell also as-idted. Then a longer interval ushc-red in tho ball. The refreshments were duly handed round, and this to"">k soms little'time, owing to the large number -of visitors present from all the surrounding diatrics. Many of them 'had good substantial appetites owiug to .their vigorous constitutions and the keen bracing air. It is a sight to be remembered to see a plate of delicacies surrounded with seven or eight hands, and two or three or more swooping down on it from above, all intent on getting a piece. There was plenty for everyone, and when the dancing began word was sent round for anyone who wanted more 'to come to the stage. It would be an im provement if the refreshments were 'han-ied round in baskets, or, failing theae, in decorated candle boxes, and 'the tea and coffee could be made in bulk in large milk cans, with taps, or, failing these, kerosene tins. The refreshments could be served out in- a very short time by these means. On such occasions modest, retiring men are served the last. But then it is the same throughout life — the aggressive, unscrupulous man fares the best. He gets tlie best woman for his wife, and secures all the good things and has a goad time generally, while the quiet, timid man ia pushed to the wall. The following ia a list of the fancy dresses on this occasion : — Mr William Monteith, "" Father Christmas"" ; Mr-11. Cockfield, ""Day and Nifht""; Mr Harry Russ 11, French cook ; Mr Theo. Rus sell, Spanish bullfighter ; Mr George Mackay, Highlander ; Mr Charles A. Hcd<tit*h, Irish bridegroom ; Mr S. M'rikimming, Bailor ; Mr John Parsons, jun , Spanish courtier ; Miss L.

The Turks have recaptured Menlik, taken by the Macedonian?, and are gradually repres sing the insurgents. August 3. M. Matakoff, an intimate friend of M. Stambouloff, has been murdered in East Roumania. August 4. Prince Ferdinand is at present at Carls bad, and a section of the press declare he is afraid to return to S- fia. Since M Sr.am bouloff resigned, Prince Ferdinand has re ceived 500 threatening letters. It is believed the country is on the eve of a revolt. M. ZankofFs party at Sofia urge- Prince Ferdinand to abdioate in favour of Prince George, of Greece. The delegates who went on a mission to Russia received an ovation on their return, and Archbishop Clement addressed the crowd, dwelling on the community of interest between Bulgaria and Russia. August 5. M. Matakoff is still alive. Constantinople, August 3. The Turkish Government havo decided to apply its own Armenian scheme of reform to the whole of the Empire. London, July 31 Reports are received to the effect that the rebellion in Macedonia has failed. The Turks systematically stopped tbe supplies of food and water, and thus the hillmen were compelled to descend to the valleys and fight in tbe open, where the larger portion were routed. A section of the insurgents, how ever, has succeeded in reorganising. Mr Gladstone addresses a public meeting on Tuesday respecting the Armenian atroci ties. It is reported that Turkey has consented to adopt the whole of the reforms in Armenia demanded by tbe European Powers. Lord Salisbury bas sent a Note to Sir P. Carrie, Ambassador to Turkey, instructing him to adopt sharper means than those of the late Government, with a view of com pelling the Sultan to institute reforms in Armenia. Mr Gladstone also urges more speed with regard to reforms. The Times. is convinced that the nations will support ■ Lord Salisbury's attitude towards the Sultan. August 1. Great Britain, France, and Ru-sia are entirely in accord in pressing reforms in Aimenia upon the Sultan. August 2. It is semi-officially stated that Russia adheres to the Berlin Treaty, and will not hold any relations with Bulgaria while Prince Ferdinand illegally assumes his title. It is also stated the other Powers approve of this attitude. The Vienna correspondent ol the Daily News says that this means the ejection of Prince Ferdinand from Bulgaria. August 5. Tbe Porte consents to apply reforms in Armenia largely based on the scheme put forward by the Powers, and will appoint a Christian assessor to each province to assist the governors, and will allow Christians a fair chare of official appointments. ' The Kurds will be given grants of land in order to stop their migrations, and thus do away with the excuse for outrages. Tbe Daily Ghroniole's correspondent re ports that the Insurgents in Macedonia defeated the Turks at Strumteza, with a loss of 500 to 100. It is reported Great Britain wishes to induce the Powers to address a Note to the Sultan stating that they will forthwith appoint a European High Commissioner to administer the Eastern Asiatic provinces in the name of the Sultan, though solely responsible to the Powers. The Sultan's reply to the demands of the Powers proposes that Christian assessors shall assist in tha appointment of sub governors and mayors, the gendarmerie and police to be equally composed of Moslems and Christians in accordance with the popula tion. He also proposes an improvement of the prisons. Bir P. Carrie has demanded the immediate release of Armenian political prisoners. The Powers will appoint a commissioner, Baron Oallay, an Austrian diplomatist, being suggested for the post. August 6. Vienna reports state that the reply of the Turkish Government to the latest demand for reform is so hostile to many of the lead- Ing points as to amount to a refusal. The Dally News believes Lord Salisbury's speech on May 24 strengthens tbe Turks in resist ing the proposal* of the Powers.",0,-2.32170878,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

285,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,212,THE ISLAND OF TRINIDAD.,"Knight's ""Cruise of the Alerto"" contains much interesting information concerning the Island of Trinidad, whioh is said to have been annexed by Great Britain, and in this book and; ""The Cruise of the Falcon"" the story is told ofi the hunts for treasure which is suppoied to bo lutied on the island. The island is situated in, the Atlantic, 700 miles from the coast of i Brazil, snd has no harbour. It is, in fact, a\ precipitous, rugged aeries of volcano oliffs on ? which it is rarely possible to land, owing to tho JI surf. It is amass of scoria, and except at an elevation of about 3000 ft, where a kind of fern ttea grows, it is treeless. The place was once naed by the Portuguese os a penal settlement, and a magnificent forest covered a large portion of the island. This,"" it is supposed, must hitvo been swept' away in some tremendous volcanio convulsion. In the year 1700 Captain H*lley (afterwards Astronomer Royal) took potiession of the island in the name of King William 111, and landed some goats and hog«. In. 1803 Commodore Delano, of the United States Navy, landed, and fouud tost the goats hogs had multiplied exceedingly, but th«y presumably dk appeared in the convuleion which dotrojed the forest. Coming to the tre&aure supposed to be buried. Thsre were troubles in Peru about 1820, the Liberators striving to throw off the yoke of Spain. Lima was a rich city, and the Liberators confiscated half the property o£ wealthy citizens for national defence. A pinio ensued, and many rich citizens, wirh tha other half of their possessions, fled. Pirates and buccaneers abounded, and they were not slow to follow on the track o£ these people fleeing with their riches. Lord Dundonald, then in the service of Chili, soon set to work to clsar the soas of these marauders. A Spanish ftigate cvptnred the piratical crow of one vessel, and taking them to Harannalr, hanged them in a row on the seashore. But one of the crew escaped and joined the British mercantile marine. The captain of the vessel on which this man served had shown him some kindness, 'and in return the ex-pirate, on his deathbed, told him a circumotaolial story of « capture of plate from some ftee'ng citizons fo Lima which was of great value. This plate and treasure had beou burhd in a ba> oq Trinidad Island. A piece of gotvtskin -with a rough plan of tho island, and a locality plan of the bey was handed to the captain. 'Ihe British captain, unable to' visit the island himself, despatched his son to seek the treasure. He was only able to land by swimming through the surf with a line attached. He inspected the place, and on being hauled on board again reported that a huge landslip had covered the place where the treasure was supposed to be. On the story gaining currency treasure-huntipg expeditions were fitted out from various places, including Southampton, which led to the writing of the charming book, Kuight's "" Cruise of the Alerte."" None of the expeditions were suece-sful. It is suggested in some quarters that the story con cerning the anm-x&Uon may hive bean canoed by pome tieswure hunters having landed at Trinidad, for it teems unlikely that Great Britain would annex an island which, from what is known of it, can serve no purpose what ever. • — A fertile source ot baldness is said to be clipping the hair close to the scalp, and thus exposing the roots to the cold.",0,-2.347664275,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proceedings of the Presbytery closed on I Wednesday, and were followed by a Soiree in the evening, which was attended by upwards of 200 persons, and produced a contribution, after clearing all expenses, of £9 ss. 4d. towards Education. The collection on Sabbath the 25th ult., for the same important object — Edu cation — amounted to upwards of £26, from which, after ded-ucting the ordinary Church door collection, will leave about £21 to be de voted to the Schools connected with the Church. Surely these facts will prove the fallacy of those frequent asseitions that the Scheme has proved a failure, and that the system of colo nization, as carried out under the auspices of the Association, has acted only as a drag on the advancement of the Province. Our space will not admit of our entering at i length on this subject. We must therefore content ourselves by asserting our conviction that the advantages of the Scheme are daily manifesting themselves in the midst of us, and that it has laid the foundation for the carrying out of every object it was designed to effect. We understand that the Land Question in all probability will shortly occupy the attention of the General Assembly. The discussion of this question will be forced on by a variety of causes, not the least amongst which is the con stant complaints from all the six Provinces of the dis- courteous conduct of the Commissioners of Crown Lands, who, with one notable except tion, have endeavoured to thwart and impede the proceedings of the Provincial Councils. Besides these causes, the question itself is be coming a most serious one, the year's experi ence of the Land Regulations under the Pro clamation of the 4th March having disclosed the working of the cheap land system, as it is called, andopened the eyes of a large number, if not the majority, of the people of the various Provinces, to the utter fallacy of that system, more especially in its effects upon the working class and small capitalists. At Canterbury, for instance, some very extensive purchases have been made, upwards of 60,000 acres having been purchased by one individual ; and pre parations were being made by the agent of a Company to effect much hrger purchases with Australian capital. Fortunately for the early settlers of the Canterbury Province, the origi nal block of the Settlement cannot be invaded ; and none of the settlers appear to appreciate this advantage more .than the labouring men and small capitalists, who feel, that were it otherwise, their chance of obtaining land with in a reasonable distance of the capital would be hopeless. — At Wellington the availability of the land in the immediate neighbourhood of the town not being great, and the best choices being already disposed of, the working of the 10s. price has not been so injurious, except that it has provided no immigration funds, and com pelled many of the public, chiefly stockholders, to purchase largely, and thus cripple the bene ficial investment of capital ; but the amount of purchases made by bona fide labouring men is ludicrously small, shewing the utter absurdity of the cry that the cheap land was to benefit the labouring man. Possibly the advantage of the cheap land has been reaped by the present settlers in this Province'more than any other ; but we are informed on the best authority that the map of selection presents such an evident monopolization of wood and water as to ren der immense tracts of land unavailable but to the fortunate holders of these choice spots, fi.r scarcely a stream of water or a patch of bush, where the same were open to selection, are left for after-comers.,. Of the effect this will have uponthe Province in after time there appears but little doubt, however much of, present ad vantage/may be reaped by individuals : i'Hs a very, questionable general policy. — At Nelson, in like manner, the whole of the available land in the vicinity of the town is chosen; indeed we are informed the whole of the best lands of the Province are being fast acquired — not'by the working classes, but by the stockholders and capitalists. But even the latter class begin to doubt the great advantage of the bargain, when they take into consideration the dearth of labour, so conspicuous to the most casual observer. Here, too, the, capitalists make no secret of the result of the low price system, re marking that the labouring classes never in vented a more effectual rod for their own backs than they have done in getting up a cry for | cheap land. Almost the whole of this latter class purchase cultivated lands in the neigh bourhood of the town, for which they pay as high as £1 5 and £20 per acre, being perfectly aware of the fact that the immediate neigh bourhood to a market, and a good road, are advantages of far greater consequence to them than lowness of price for the land. — At Tara naki the low price system can scarcely be said to be fully at work, the difficulty of effecting purchases from the natives, or getting posses sion of the land when the purchase has been completed, and the conflict between the Pro vincial powers and the Commissioner of Crown Lands, rendering land sales extremely slow ; and in many cases small capitalists have been much crippled in their resources, from the heavy expenses incurred before they could get on to their lands. — At Auckland we under stand the speculative^purchases are very ex tensive, and as new land becomes open for se lection, it is immediately applied for in some cases by officials themselves, and in most cases by parties who have obtained information through official channels. The effect of this system is, that a stranger has no chance of an original grant, but must, purchase second hand, at a greatly advanced rate. An instance is told of a native having purchased a block of land at 10s. per acre, and of ha\ing re-sold it immediately afterwards for £2 per acre. The purchase of land is consequently just a scram ble for the public property, the effects of which are stated to be so mischievous, that an in stance is publicly stated of a shipload of immi grants from Australia, some 70 in number, having landed at Auckland under the impres sion that they could buy cheap land, and after wasting money and time in the vain endeavour to obtain it, the most of them left New Zealand to seek their fortunes elsewhere. These facts are exerting a great effect upon the public mind. Hundreds who a few months since were strenuous advocates for the ' low price, are now quite on the other side; and doubtless the speculators having acquired blocks of land according to their means, would now willingly see an advance made in the price of the public lands, as it would give them a better market for their purchases. All these things are tending to produce a reaction in the I course of events ; and there not having arrived, or being a hope of the arrival of, we believe, a single immigrant assisted under the Govern ment Regulations, is, under the pressure of want of labour of all kinds, accelerating that reaction. It therefore becomes a very serious question with the public of Otago — Whether it is worth while, for the sake of making the fortunes of a few speculators, to lower the price of their land, and then raise it again, creating specula tion and confusion. Our settlers generally were willing to make alterations in their Terms of Purchase, and to reduce the price of their public land to somewhere about.£l an acre; and, as we understand there is every probabili ty — we may almost say that it is a certainty— that the General Assembly will place ' the ma nagement of the lands of each Province under the control of its local authorities it is desir able, that until the public have irunie up their minds what the alteration in their terms of pur- Chase shall hi, that the present confused, un certain, and wasteful method of disposing of the bush lands, public ferries, and 'spots of ge neral public utility, should cease. , We there fore congratulate our readers' on the important despatches which have been received by the "" Despatch,"" by which we understand the Com missioner of Crown Lands has been directed not to sell any land within the Province of Otago without the consent of the Superinten dent, until such time as -the General Assembly shall have dealt with the question— a check upon the Commissioner of Crown Lands (in the present transition state of affairs), the more necessary from the well-known desire of that officer to impede the public business of the Province, and to create confusion by the dis posal of public reserves, not in accordance with the engagements under which the settlers of Otago left their native land. > We learn from Auckland that the Govern ment Brig reached the seat of Government on the 22nd May, two days before the meeting of the General Assembly, having on board our three Representatives, and Messrs. E. G. and E. J. Wakefield. The passage was extremely tedious and stormy, and doubts were enter tained whether the brig would arrive in time. The steamer "" Nelson"" arrived at Manakau on the same day, but owing to the absence of the pilot from his station, she was enable to get into the harbour until the following morning. Nearly the whole of the Members from various Provinces were brought by her, and also many of the Nominees, Captain Bellairs, the nominee for Otago, having been left behind at Nelson, •we regret to hear, in consequence of the indis position of Mrs. Bellairs. The passage by the steamer is said to have been agreeable as far as the weather was concerned, but the passen gers complain much of the incivility and want of proper management on board, and also of the unaccommodating spirit of the agents. Messrs. Macandrew, Cargill, and Cutten, our Members to the General Assembly, had an in- Sarview with His Excellency the Officer ad ministering the Government at Auckland on 25th May, on the subject of the administration of the Crown Lands in the Province of Otago. His Excellency received the deputation with great courtesy, and expressed his anxious de sire to meet the views of the colonists of Ot&go, and to respect the engagements of Her Majes ty's Government, and his regret that the local affairs of the Government should have taken a position hostile to the Provincial Government. A MEETING of the Bench of Magistrates was held in the Mechanics' 1 Institution on the 30th ult., for the purpose of hearing objections to claims for enrolment as Voters under the Con stitution Act, and for revising the Electoral Roll. There being only eight objections, all of which were sustained, the business was soon brought to a close.",0,-2.362674104,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1854/07/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the latter were"" « number from Ohrislcburcb, Timaru, Geraldine, »""d Winchester. The Hev. Father Fauvtl'a carriage also formed part of the procession. On nearing the park the belh of the Catholic Church were tolled, their mournful notes ringing out lit intervals until the cemetery was reached. On arrival at the gate of the cemetery it had been arranged that the pall bearers should have the privilege of conveying the remains to their last resting place, but owing to the immense concourse of people it whs found impossible to carry out this arrangement. Indeed, so great was 'he throng that it was with the utmost dim culty that the relatives and chief mourners could approach the grave. The beautiful ceremonial of the Church of England having been concluded, and the last token of affection and respect having been paid to the deceased, the Rev. T. A. Hamilton delivered a brief but impressive exhorta tion to the yaßt throng assembled, re minding them that man's life was but a pilgrimage, and that, his earthly body was but as it were the tent of the soldier or pioneer pitched at various places in life's pilgrimage, and finally struck for ever. He urged them therefore, as the delegate of the Great Commander, to be ready for that last great day. The benediction was then pronounced amidst solemn silence. At this time fully 1500 persons were pre sent, and it was not. for some hours that the concourse dispersed. Pulpit Refe3ENCes. At St. Saviour's Church in the evening hymns appropriate to the ceremonial of the afternoon were sung, and the Incum bent delivered an impressivo address from the text—"" When my heart is overwhelmed lf>ad me to the rack ihot is higher than I."" In the course of his aormon he referred to many generous acts of the decensed towardß tha church, and the very material help he had given towards the erection of the present build ing. At the Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Father Fauvel at Benediction said that ho had causor) the bell to be tolled on behalf of himself and his parishioners through a sense of gratitude and honor for thehte Mr Hayhnrst. That gentleman was ene of the earliest benefactors of the church in the district, the section upon which the old church was erected being his gift. The tolling of the bolls was the voice of himself and parishioners pealing forth their just sense of gratitude for the kindness of one of their benefactors.",0,-2.363010063,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/temuka-leader/1889/04/09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Burmah hasso far been singularly free from inquisitive novelists, and ""Mimosa ""has chosen a promising subject for her pen, and has the additional advan tage of having many years' experience of Bur mese life. • . • The forty-first volume of Mr Unwin's ""Story of the Nations"" series is "" Vedicl ndia,"" by Madame Zena'ide A.

The siDger may be a very clever one, and I believe she is, but still it cer tainly hardly sesms tha correct thing for a writer of opera to compose music-hall songs, although many of tbe Italian opera com posers wrote songs that were not worthy of performance at a music hall. • . • Do cheap editions kill dearer editions 1 Not always, it seems. Mr Gosse, writing to Mr Stead on the subject of ""The Penny Poets,"" says : — "" I remember being told by my friend Mr Coventry Patmore that the issue of the Cassell edition (3d) of 'The Angel in the House,' of which an enormous number was sold, positively and immediately Increased the sale of the 5s edition."" • . Mr Thomas Hardy's story, which has already borne two titles in the pages of Harper's Magazine — ' ""The Simpletons ;earts Insurgent ""—is to bear yet anotbff when it is issued in book form. In book form, by the way, "" Hearts Insurgents '""will-, like "" Teas of tha D'UrbarvMes,"" show a greater amount of unconventiaHfcy than was possible In serial form. What a rash there will be for it I • .• Mr Wilfrid Ward's ""Life and Times o« Cardinal Wiseman"" is in preparation for early publication by Messrs Longmans, Green, and Co. Some interesting lettera from Lord Beaconpfleld, Dr Db'llioger, Car dinal Manning, Mr Gladstone, Lord HougH< ton, Pugin, the Chevalier Bunsen, and otheff celebrities will appear in the work, which will also contaia reminiscences of Dr Wiseman; by Lord Acton, Mr Gladstone, Cardinal Vaughan, and others. • . • Richard Hengiut Home's "" Orion "" was published 52 years ago at a farthing as ari ""experiment upon the mind of a nation.!* The author ventured thus rashly, "" as there was scarcely any insbanoo of an epic poem attaining any reasonable circulation during its author's lifetime."" Three-farthing edi tions appeared, and copies of them nowa days fetch a good deal. Afterwards, as Home said, several more editions (six at least) were published at a price which amply remunerated the publisher, and left tha author no great loser. ■ . ■ Belfast boasta another new novelist- Mr Robert Cromie to wit — who is employed in one of the banki in that city. His firs t novel, "" A Plunge Into Space,"" has been a great succeai ; and his latest, "" The Crack of Doom,"" published a few weeks back by Messrs Digby, Long, and Co., gives promise of being equally well received. Another writer of rising fame. Mrs E. Rentoul Eater, is also a native of Belfaßt ; and the same can. be said of Mr S. R. Eeightley, whose historical romance, "" The Crimßon Sign,"" appeared last year. •.•lt is said that Verdi is writing an opera which will be a sort of souvenir of tha late Ismail Pasha. When Ismail was in all the glory of hU Khedeviata he commissioned the great composer to write an opera in cele bration of the opening of the Suez Canal ; and after the curtain fell on the first performance Ismail expressed his extreme gratification by presenting Verdi with the extrumely agree able honorarium of 150,000fr, or £6000. At that time poor old Ixmail was reputed to hold about £7,600,000 worth of shares in the canal. • . • Frances Burney'B copy of the inimit able "" History of Sandford and Merton "" 1b to be sold by auction.

94,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,21,OTAGO CENTRAL RAILWAY LEAGUE.,"The monthly meeting of the committee of the Obago Central Railway League was held in the Chambsr of Commerce on Monday evening ; present — Messrs W. Barron (chairman), A. Bathgate, H. Slater, S. N. Brown, J. Jolly jun., A. C. Stronach, and J. Carroll. Apologies tor the non-attendance of Messvs A. Sligo and G. L. Dennis.on were received. OFFICE-BEARERS. Tfce followiog cmce-bearera were elected : — Chairman, Mr W. Barron ; vice-chairman, Sir J. Carroll ; Finance Committee — Messrs A. C. Stron&ch, T. Brown, A. B*thgate, and P. R. Sargood ; treasurer,- Mr G. L. Denniiton ; secretary, Mr S. C. Leary. In acknowledging his re-election, Mr Barron said it was pretty hard that the chairman and those associated with him in the work of the league should have such a vety slender response on the part of the publ c in strengthening their h&ndt. He was sure the league was doing good work, but the public did Lot seem to appreciate that fact nor to appreciate the necessity of pushing on this work. Mr Careolt, thought that steps should be taken to communicate with important unions and other organisations to take an interest in the league's work, and strengthen its 'hands as much as possible. Ie answer to Mr Slater, The Chairman said that the league had no formal constitution. Mr Slater then moved that a committee consisting of Messrs Sligo, Biown, and the mover b3 appointed to draw up rules for the constitution of the league and to devise means for increasing the membership, and to rvport to next meeting. The motion i*as carried. ' The Chairman said that since the annual meeting oh the league Mr Piuk«rton had for warded a, paper giving the figures which it was j thought would be required for the annual ! meeting Figures were got from the appro priation accounts for the annual meeting, and he found that the figures that were mads use of at thfct meeting were very similar to those in the return forwarded by Mr Pinkerton. This return was so full that probably it would be as well to read it. It was as fol lows : — ""Statement showing expenditure on the Otngo Central railway for the year ended 31st March 1895 : Out of vote for con 1 - I ruction, £28,131; permanent way, £1866; laud claims and works oh open lines, £390 ; — total, £30,487 Liabilities on 31ht March 1895, £13,769. These liabilities they, of course, had no means of analysing, and they did not know of what they might consist, but the work should have gone on until the 30th of June at the same rate of expendi'ure. He might just remind thorn that the It ague had once or twice to briDg under the notice of the Government the fact that the expenditure was nor, in the opinion of the league, going on fast enough to absorb the vote, and they were told then that it w*s absolutely necsbsary that the expenditure should be spread over, not the financial year, but practically 15 months — that was to say, it would not do to exhau&t the vote before March 31, otherwise the work would have to stop, pending further provioion being made for it in the House. He just mentioned this again simply to say that there was ample provision made in the act of Parliament under which such expenditure took place to warrant Ministers in going on with the work, even if the vote was absorbed. He noticed the other day iv looking fct Hansard a clear illustration of what nil along had been the contention of the league — that the work could go on after March 31 until the Government made further provision for it. Sir Robert Stout asked the Minister for Lands by what authority certain expenditure in excess of vote was made for roads and surveys in the Uriwera country. The Hon. John M'Kenzie replied: ""The hon. gentleman mutt bs aware that the Public Revenues Act authorises the Govern ment during three months — from April 1 to June 30 — to expend the balance of the pre vious year's vote, together with a fourth of the amount of that vote."" It therefore appeared that the Public Revenues Act authorised the Government to spend an amount equal to a fourth of the amount of the vote on the Obago Central to keep the work going from March 31 to June 30 — chat was to Bay, if the vote was ab sorbed on March 31, the Government would have authority to go on with the work for three months. Had the Government expended the £30,000 — which, according to the returns sent by Mr Pinkerton, they had spent — had they ab sorbed the whole of the vote of £45,000 and the authorisation of £15,000, they could still have gone on under the authority of the Public Revenues Act at the same rate of expendi ture until the 30th of June, and Parliament would have considered the expenditure per fectly legal, and it would have appeared on the Estimates for the ensuing year. Then, in the return which Mr Pinkerton had kindly sent, there was a statement showing the expenditure on the Obago Central railway for the period from April 1, 1894, to June 30, 1895. This showed pxp.;nfliture oub of vote tor cjn-truc tion £38 768. This included the estimated amount for the May and June co-operative payments, the vouchers not yet being to hand. There was aUo expended out of vote for perma nent way £1966, land claims and additions to open lines £5647, making a total of £46,381. The liabilities on June 30, 1895, amounted to £15,329. Another itatement forwarded by Mr Pinkerton showed tho amount appropriated and expended on the construction of railways during the financial year 1894 95 :—Efceta huna-Woodville — amount appropriated £40,000, amount expended £25,849; Ot»go Oeutrftl— amount appropriated £45,000, amount ex pended £28.131 ; Catlins River— amount appro priated £10,000, amount expended £6863; Sesward Bush — amount appropriated £15,000, amount expended £8478. Iv the appropriation account there were simillfc figures, but there were one or two lines which were not men tioned in the return forwarded by Mr Finkerton. In the appropriation it was stated that the amount expended on tho Greymouth- Hokitika line was £13,102, credits £124, and net expenditure £12 978, advances £1212, making a tct*l of £14,191 expended out of a vote of £15,000—50 that on the Grejmouth- H< kitika line the vote was absorbed all bat £808, and if this had been put on the return sent to the league they might have drawn rather different conclusions. Looking at the matter any way the Grey mouth- Hokitika line nearly absorbed its vote, aud the Otago Central O'jly absorbed two-thirds of its vote. Then there was an authorisation of £15,000 which was not 6hown on the return. However, if they had a better vote and a bett»r expenditure next year they would not say much about it. It was decided to instruct the secretary to convey tbe thanks of the league to Mr Pinker ton for his courtesy in forwarding the return.",0,-2.482378607,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dunedin Assembly of the Knights of Labour at their usual meeting, held on Thursday evening, adopted the following resolutions : — "" That this »8f emblj records it emphatic protest agsiost the greatly increased taxation of the people by means of the new tariff ; that such taxation will bear very heavily on the industrial and working classes, and under the present depressed state of the colony is extremely ill-advised."" ""That this ai>B< mbly, in con formity with its preamble, heartily endorses the referendum, and tenders its best thanks to Mr O' Regan and those members of tha House who voted for the second reading of the Referendum Bill. It expresses its strong hope that Parlia ment will phow its trust in the people, from whom it derives its power, by adopting this great Democratic principle without delay."" Dr B-lcherhas forwarded to the High Schools B>ard six months' notice of bis resignation of the position of rector of the Boys' High School. The resignation, which will take eff-ct from the Ist February next, is not unexpected, Dr Belcher having tome time since mentioned to some of his friends that he would probably retire from the position and return to England.

Speeches wero also given by Mr Beck .(vice-prenidenfc, who was elected from among tbe yonng men, and wbo returned thanks for the honour conferred on him), Messrs E. G. AlUn, A. Thomson, and R. Baucbop. Mr Wilson proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the ladies, and called on the young men to give three hearty cheers for the committee of the Mechanics' Institute. This terminated a very pleasant evening. At last weeks meeting of tha City Council the mayor drew attention to the faot that the Govrrument proposed to place an ad valorem duty of 20 per cent, upon all gasometers and gas appliances. What made him more particu larly allude to the matter was a knowledge of the fact that in all probability the corporation would be compelled within 12 months to import a new gasometer, and th*t would cost from £15,000 to £20,000 The duty would, there fore, come to about £2000. That seemed to be an enormous tax to place upon a public body, and he would suggest that the Government and city members be communicated with with the view of representing that local bodies who erected their own gasworks should be exempt from the t»x. The suggestion was agreed to. The vital statistics for the month just ex pired are as follow:— Births, 110; deaths, 45; and marriages, 26. For July last year the figures were : Births, 125 ; deaths, 56 ; and marriages, 21. The City Council last week appointed Mr S. G. Cameron, of Melbourne, as expert inspector of the public abattoir. Messrs Reid aud Gray telegraphed on the 31st to the Treasurer as follows :—"": — "" We respect fully express our dissent from the duty of 20 per cent — or, roughly, £100— imposed on trac tion engines, as tbes« are cbit-fly imported for threshing purposes, and already cost £500 laid down. Surely this item must be unintentional, as the traction engines could not be made ia the colonies with any prospect of success for many yean to come, and as far as we can see the only result wiuld be that farmers would have to be charged higher rates than at present for their thre«hmg to recoup threshers for tbe extra outlay. We would respectfully but most strongly urge tbat this item be continued on the free list."" A meeting of the committee of the New Zealand Women's Missionary Society was held on the 30ih. when a favourable repott of the health of Miss MacGregor, the society's agent in Zenana work lately iv Madras, was received. It was deemed not desirable that Miss Mac- Gregor should return immediately to India, and steps were taken to a* certain a suitable field in the Hills where Miss MacGregor might make available her acquisition of the Tamil language in Zenana work, the secretary being instructed to communicate with the American Presbyterian Board of Mildura. It was agreed to give Miss MacGregor a temporary allowance in connection with the services she in rendering to the society in bringing the claims of the Zenana mission before the friends of missions. The secretary (Miss Fulton) read the following progress report : — *' We are glad to report the in creasing interestof working pa> ties in the sending of boxes to India and other countries. A letter from tbe north shows tbat a promise made eoaae time ago has been remembtiv d by the W C T U. of Napier, who are forwarding the work done to the care of Mrs Banntrman. Anderson's Bay and West Taieri are also contributing. We hope to receive parcels from other friends who can give time to sewing the garments, according to the patterns received from Miss M&cGregor, and now in the hands of Mrs Ban nerman, Roslyn. Some wall cards, in paint, have beeu received from a friend in Timaru. It may be interesting to the committee to know that a covenant for missionary effort has been adopted in America, in which we might join, and which is as follows — viz , ' I am mindful that vast numbers. of women and girls can never hear the gl»d tidings of great joy unless a Christian woman be sent to them, and I gladly enter into a covenant of obedience to make offerings of prayers, time, and money, to send the Gospel to those dark places of the earth. '""Lord make it, This work of our hands, that so we may Lift up our eyes, and dare to pray : The work of our hands, establish Thou it— For ever and aye.' "" The Taieri Courty Couucil, by five votes to three, on Friday granted its consent to thq application of the City Council for the right to erect the public abattoir within the oonnty. It would appear that leg&l opinion is considerably divided as to fcbe legal right of the City Couneii to erect the abattoir ob a site within half a mile of the B >rough of Caversham, three opinions having beeu laid before the County Council to the effect that, under the provisions of the Abattoirs Act, the proposal to erect the premises on the site which has been purchased is illegal, and these opinions being met by three other opinions to the contrary effect. Our Wellington correspondent telegraphs :—: — "" A writ for libel will, I believe, presently be issued at the instance of the Government Insurance department against a New Zealand journal for strictures published upon the con duct of its business. The damages are put at £5000, and the journal mentioned is Christ church Truth."" The Times, of June 22, relates that Dr Pasteur aad othen were made the victims of a rather painful practical joke. It was reported in Paris that the Berlin Academy of Sciences had decided to recommend that the Prussian order of merit should be given to a number of French savants, with Pasteur at their bead. Upon this Dr P<tgteur publicly announced that he, as a FrenohmaD, could not dream of accept ing such a thing at the hands of the Germans. At this spirited announcement the French people overwhelmed Pasteur with congratula tions, and s'arted several public subscriptions for presenting him with a service of plate and a testimonial in the form of a bronze allegorical figure of Strasburg, and with a grand patriotic banquet. These enthusiastic proceedings were later Bomewhat chilled by the discovery at Berlin that the Academy of Sciences had never taken any such action or ever talked of doing so. If the origii 41 rumour had any basis what ever, it would »i \ .rently be founded on some notion of the Kaiser that it would be a pleasant thing to do. Mr W. J. Bastard, of Islington, has built a model of a navigable balloon, designed expressly for long journeys,, explorations, and warfare, and having, according to its inventor, capa bilities of navigating in the air in much the same way as a ship on water. The body of the balloon (as described to a Pall Mall Gazette in verviewer) is of a tubular form, pointed at each end, enclosed in a framework of metal, and made in auoh a way as will give ib utmost rigidity. The fans, sorews, rudders, and all working parts are attached to this framework, no weight whatever being on the gas envelope. The car is suspended from the main central rib in hollow journals, so that it at all times hangs level, in whatever direction the body may be pointed, up or down tbe car. A boat is carried for the purpose of coming down on the water instead of land, two canvas tanks being ue ed as a water anchorage. For the pur poses of warfare the body of the balloon would be made in sections, and filled with small envelopes containing gas. The balloon weighs 20851b. It is 112fo long, 33ft in diameter; it is capable of holding 99,000 ft of gas, with a lift ing power of 35001b. The screws and fans can be actuated by the passengers, each working independently of the others ; thus, one side in an adv<prce wind would back, the opposite side go abend, and by the use of rudders and sails iv like manner, the balloon would be able to pretty well ohoose its own oourse. About £1000, or less, would be required to build a balloon after the inventor's designs. The arrears claimed by the Crown from tenants in the Wellington district amount to £11,^20, of which £2000 is owing by "" special"" settlers. The Minister has directed that where rents are two years overdue steps are to be taken to secure forfeiture, subject to the merits of each case. The members of the Dunedin Field Club and friends to the number of about 50 met in the Young Women's Christian Association's Rooms en Friday evening to hear a lecture by Mr G. M. Thomson, F L.S., on •• The Crustacea : A Study ia Development."" The leoturer dealt with his subject in an admirable manner. He traced the development of all classes of crus tacea, and illustrated his remarks with a number of diagrams. At the close of the address, on the motion of the Rev. Mr Dutton, who presided, a vote of thanks to Mr Thomson was carried by acclamation. Mr A. Wilson especially dwelt upon the pleasure he had received in listening to the lecture, and related some observations he had made of the Crustacea in the South Sea Islands during a holiday sojourn there. The next lecture will be delivered by Professor Parker. la its reporb of the case Anderion and another v. Logan, in the Court of Sessions, Edinburgh, in May last, the Scotsman has the following : — "" Th« defender here (Abraham Logan, Whitton, Morebattle, Kelso) is a sou of the late James Logan, who died some time ago, leaving considerable property in New Zealand and Scotland. The Scottish heritable property included Morebattle Main*, which, by arrange ment with the trustees, was acquired by the defender. In this action Frederick William Reynolds Anderson, 45 Crowtidale road, Lon don, and his son Stanley George Henry Ander son asked declarator that the defender pur chased Morebattle Mains as their agents ; that he now holds it in trust for them, and that he was bound to convey it to them. Lord Low to-day dismissed the action with expenses. The question, he said, was whether the aver ments of the pursuer* were relevant to support the conclusions of the summons. It w»a not said that the contract was constituted by writing, and it was admitted that there was no rei interventus, and it was clear that if the alleged contract was one for the sale of heritage it could not be enforced."" Writing on Jane 21, our London corres pondent says :—"": — "" It is announced that the directors of the New Zealand Midland Railway Company have cabled to Mr A. Wilson, M lust C.E., their manager in New Zealand, with reference to the action of the New Zea land Government in seizing the property ot the company ai follows : ' Protest strongly ; com mence no action ; we are advised seizure illegal. Note to make additional claims for heavy damages before arbitrators.' This looks dangerous. lam afraid some serious trouble is impending over this matter. There, are some strong men behind the Midland Company in a certain sense, and they are desperately in dignant at the way they have been treated."" The only case that came before Mr Warden C»rew on Friday, at the sitting of the Warden's Court, was an application by P. A. Lyders for a renewal of HcenEe over a prospecting area at M'Phee's Point, museum endowment reserve, N<n thorn. The matter was adjourned to the 6th September. The Invereargill manager of the Bank of New Zealand having po : nted out to Mr John M'Qtiean, of Kn&pdsle, that certain statements made in a circular issued by him as chairman of the Shareholders' Committee of the South land-Frozen Meat Company were quite ui-trne, Mr M 'Queen has withdrawn the statement, which wat to the effect that the bank refused to give any extension of time except for the purpose of amalgamation with the Ocean Beach Company. Mr ' M'Queen s<ud the statement was based on the reply to a question given by tbe chairman of directoi s of the company, that "" there was one condition attached to the extenhion of time by the bank. It was that the directors were in earnest with regard to amalgamation."" In a letter to the Southland Times concerning tbe libel action which it is said the Hon. Mr Ward has instructed his solicitors to commence, Mr M'Qaeen says :—: — ""Is it not strange that it never seems to have occurred to the great man that a satisfactory explanation might have been given if he had applied to tho proper party in the usual way ; instead of which he seizes on a cap, which he says somebody else told him was his, not only pnts it on his head but actually pulU it hard down over his eyes, and then demands that I should prove that the cap belongs to him. Now, Sir, is that fair ?"" Me«srs J. and A. Wilkie, the New Zealand contractors for the Southern Croes-Coolgardie railway, intended, uncording to a We»t Aus tralian paper, to hav^ the first 20 miles of rail way open on Thursday last, the Ist of August. They proposed, if possible, to lay the line at the rate of one mile a day. They intended that the contract should not only be the cheapest, but that the railway should be the most quickly constructed line in Australia.

A distinct shook of earthquake wa? felt ia Dunedin just as the town clock was striking 6 on Sunday evening. The apparent direction was from N. to 8.

Judge presiding. Ifc was decided that' Labour Day be celebrated by a demonstration and sports on Wednesday, October 9, and that any surplus arising therefrom be handed over to the Miner*' Association fund. With a view to making the surplus a large one it was decided to have lists printed for tho purpose of receiving donations to the prize fund. The Sports Com mittee submitted a draft programme, consisting of 25 events, but, as no replies had been received from the oyoling olubs and fire brigade?, tho adoption of it was held over till the next meeting, to bo held on Wednesday. 21st. The monthly meeting of the Dunedin branch of the Obago Educational Institute, held at the Normal School on Saturday, was attended by Mr J. A. Johnson (in the chair), Messrs G M Thomson, J.

Barrett, and Miss Cairns, tit Thomson wan to have read a paper on ""Botany in our Primary Schools,"" but was asked, and contented, to postpone doing so as there was not a very good attendance. Mr G. M. Thom son inquired if there was any provision made in the primary schools for instruction in the metric system. He would like the Otago Institute to pass a resolution urging the Government to bring the system into more general use. With the exoeption of England and Russia, all the European countries ware adopting it, and the timo was coming when ib would bave to be considered. The Chairman said that the metric system was taught in the Sixth Standard, but he did not know that it occupied a prominent position. It was decided to consider the matter at the next meeting of the branch. At the Port Chalmers Court on Saturday D. K. Fisher was oharged with neglecting to have his child vaccinated. Defendant stated that his reason for refnsal was his belief that it would injure his child. Many doctors in Scotland and England were against it, he added, and ia the House of Commons in 1893 the motion for repealing the act was supported by' more than one-third of the members of the House, while discussions upon the subject had taken place ia New South Wales, and a motion was before the House of Parliament in Wellington that vacci nation should be optional. Thomas Hinchliff, the registrar, read the clause in the act, and said tbat he had frequently given defendant notice under the act. If the defendant objected to the law be should try and have it amended. The Bench (Messrs J. Watson, jun , and J. B. Morson) said they were in sympathy with the defendant, but the law must be obeyed, and a fine of Is, with 7s costs, would be inflicted. By the will of the late Mr James Alexander, of Wanganui (says the New Zealand Times), tho sum of £5400 is left in trust for charitable purposes, £4000 to be disposed of as Miss Alex* ander shall by her will appoint, the charitable purposes to be within the definition of "" charitable bequests "" as contained in the ""Charitable Gifts Duties Exemption Act 1893."" The remaining £1000 is to go to the miuiater of the -Established K<rk of Lawrence kirk, Scotland, and is to be expended within 10 years for the benefit of the poor inhabitants of that parish. On the death of Mrs Alexander a legacy of £400, free of duty, is 1 to be expended in rebuilding the Presbyterian Church in Wan ganui, or, if it shall have been rebuilt by that time, towards paying oft any debt on the church, The Press states that on account of the great depth of snow, and the almost impossibility of their reaching their destination, the police at Ashburton have decided to abandon the idea of Bending out a party to search for the man Duncan, who is supposed to have perished during the late sevore w eather near the head of the Rakoia river.",0,-2.535442317,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the female celebrities had gathered in the gal leries, with the great actress at their head, grown a good deal stouter. She was fol lowed by a retinae of admirers and mobbed by a large crowd, 80 much so that Dataille, Oarolns Daian, and Pavls de Ohavannes, who escorted her, had actually to use their elbows, and even their heels, to make room for her to proceed along. Ske wore a cos tame of grass-green cloth, out in patterns, on a silk petticoat"" of apple green, and on her hair was lost and buried, amid a disorderly bush of fluffy curls, a bouquet of real flowers of the season, in the middle' of which a tulip, unique and proud, was balancing its reddish purple head. The word 'caricature* .escaped many a feminine mouth, and, in fact, one woman alone in tbe world oould have offered such a sight without provoking a smile of astonishment to say the least of it, and this woman is Sarah Bernhardt, the everlasting puzzle, to whom all things are allowed because she does all things like no body else."" * . ■ There is one phase of tuition,, such as I provide, that the public know very little of, and which is yet perhaps the most lucrative line I have (said an actress of world- wide note who now takes a great number of higher class pupils in the elocutionary art). I call this branch accent teaohlng : the instruc tion of pupils in the accent common to edu cated English people the whole world over. Most of my pupils are American ladies, but they are by no means confined to the gentler sex, for I have before now had American senators, and grave and reverend signors from other English-speaking communities, as pupils. Only recently, as an example, I tutored a Canadian Minister of State, high in office, and I am now coaching an American judge and a distinguished clergyman from tbe same country. I nave been paid very large fees indeed by American ladies, who would not make their appearance in English society till I had countenanced their doing so. Of actors, actresses, and singers — the latter especially, strange to say — from America and from the colonies I have had a host, some of tbe actresses refraining abso lutely from appearing on the English boards till I had thoroughly coached them. It is not for me to boast, but I do not think that tbe particular accent of any country or dis trict is so hard to cast as it is generally deemed to be, and I have the greatest admi ration for tbe talents of the American women in this way. Same Home Fashions. THE STYLE OF HAIRDKESSIN«. Some ate wearing the hair a little lower in the nape of the neck, but more throw it back over a cushion, lightly fluffed out like the pictures of Marie Antoinette, whose pretty fichu is also much worn. Bat it is well to remember that, amongst the gens eomme il faut in .Paris, and consequently soon in London, golden hair, unless evidently of Nature's providing, is almost vulgar, while rouge is entirely bo. The fact is the brilliant colour now in vogue absolutely demands dark hair and eyes to throw it up, and with this a gentle pallor is considered most suitable. You a6k as to BONNETS. Well, ma ohere, plainly speaking, they are mostly hideous I This is a hard saying, but is true nevertheless, though our taste is bo vitiated by Madame la Mode that we still say "" How pretty ! "" to headgear that a year or two ago we should have rushed from. Still, there are very pretty specimens, and tbe black tulle or chiffon hats especially Attract me. The shape is rather quaint. The brim is wide, and may take any pleats fancy dictates, bat the crown is either jam pot-shape, or of a mitigated hour-glass form, depressed in the middle and wide at top and bottom, so arranged as to form a kind of little full ruche round, the edge, a narrow ' black satin ribbon being carelessly tied with loose ends and knots round the crown, against which lean some black ostrich tips, caught in place with a paste stud, this having more or less succeeded to the honours of the buckle. By the way, did I tell yon of UHE LATEST EXTBAVAGANCE '—. namely, white muslin or lace flounces for jilk underskirts. Well, thoy «c a fact, the skirt being usually of some delicate light shade, in one of the oheap Bilks, the flounce being almost knee deep, and if of muslin has two or three rows of lace insertion aB well as the lace edge. I expeot we shall follow it up later in the season by putting blaok muslin or lace flounces to our darker silk skirts, and thus utilising them when half worn. Pearls are THE PBEVAILINB JEWELI/EBT, and everyone sports ropes of pearl that wonld be a credit to Lord Beaconsfield's "" Oorisande,"" just as a year ago every woman, no matter what her position, wore diamonds. They probably came from the same plaoe, the Parisian Diamond Company, whose pearls are as lustrous as their beauti ful paste. You see, pearls appear to be fairly easy of imitation, the only drawback to the artificial ones being that after much wear they lose their artificial lustre and grow dim and dull, whereas the real gem, if fairly treated, improves with age. Have you ever noticed how differently the universal coat and skirt is worn 1 On one woman it is rampantly agressive, masculine, and repulsive to a degree, whilst on another it is ridiculously feminine and attractive. This struck me watching two women the other day who are great friends and dress as much alike as if they were sisters. The dress was silver grey alpaca, with a white ahirt, and silver grey boat-shaped felt hats. One had a stiff-fronted white ahirt, emphasising the faot that she Is as sexless as one of Giotto's angels, the stern, business-like hat set mathematically straight on her carefully arranged hair, and, though she is really a very nice and womanly person, your first impression is that you have at last caught the much-talked-of New Woman ; her'f riend wears a soft silk or cambric shirt, hanging full from neck to waist, her short hair all ruffled into curls like a boy's, wears her jaunty, dented hat with a cock, a white pen feather being carelessly stack through the hat band, and is in reality just as resolute and independent a little sft 3 in of woman hood as exists; yet the average outsider's first impression is of her exceeding softness and gentleness, whereas no falcon was ever more plucky and adventurous ; and it's just the way she wears her clothes !

311,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,238,THE LEADER EXPEDITION IN FIORDLAND.,"No. 11. Tbe Lake Mintaro hut, though not a very comfortable one, is always a welcome sight after a day's hard swagging, and on this occasion, when we had got rid of our swags and cameras, shovelled the snowdrift away from the door, and lighted a roaring fire in the capacious chimney, we thought it quite palatial. It is situated near the source of the Clinton r'mr, and almost at the foot of MKinnon's Pass. Lake Mintaro, on which it stands, is a pretty tarn, fringed on one side with beech forest, in which the trees are white with clinging mosses, and bordered on the other side by a narrow flat that stretches to the foot .of Mount Balloon. The valley is narrow and gloomy — almost com pletely shut in from the winter sun. Looking up the valley from the door of the hut is seen the saddle over which the pass was made, Mount Hart towering up to the left. Across the lake the grim precipices of Mount Balloon, in accessible from this side, rise in wild grandeur for thousands of feet— a solid wall of black granite seamed with snow ; while just overhead, on the left, the enormous precipices of the mountain range in places overhang, and seem ready at any moment to topple over and encom pass our destruction. Fyfe and I spent the remainder of the after noon photographing and exploring our imme diate surrounding?, intending on the morrow to take light swags to the top of the pass and see if the rocky buttress of Mount Balloon just above the saddle would ""go."" Looking at it from the vallf y it seemed just possible that the ascent might be practicable from the saddle, and, once upon the peak that overlooks the pass, we saw that we could, by continuing along the arete gain the highest point of the mountaiu about a quarter of a mile further along tbe range. We strolled along the lake shore admiring tbe marvellous reflections; they seemed more real than the reality. A half buried snow-covered boulder, with rounded top, was transformed into a perfect circle, while neighbouring tree and distant mountain were faithfully duplicated, and the veiy birds as they sate motionless on the water looked at them selves as in a mirror — The Swan on still St. Mary's Lake floats double— Swan and shadow. With the dying day the gloom of the narrow valley deepened. The glow of sunset fell for a few moments on the mountains down the valley, and the tracery of the dark beech trees stood boldly out against the gold. The trumpet note of the Paradise ducks sounded from the lake, and the plaintive cry of the orarge-wattlod crow— three clear sad notes in a minor key — came from the hillside in the dyiDg day. It grew cold, so we returned to the hut, and piled up the beech logs till we made a roaring fire. Afterwards we had supper — a savory onion stew, tinned apricots, bread and jam and the usual billy tea ; and then a game of ciibbsge, a final pipe, and bed. Next morning Fjfe and 1 started off after breakfast to reconnoitre the peak from tha saddle, leaving Mrs Ross alone in camp to sketch and cook. We took with us our sleeping bagA, provisions, ice axes, alpine rope, and the camera. The path led along the valley for af aw hundred yards, and then through the forest, in a slanting direction, up towards the saddle. The track was deep in snow and all the foot holds obliterated, so that with a swag, a camera in one hand and an ice axe in tbe other, the scenery, so to spenk, had to take a back seat. We climbed through the mor ning mists that hung in the valley, and, emerging from the bu-h, began to a«cend the snow-covered, grassy slopes. We misted the track once, and had a bad quarter of an hour on a steep face, but the enow poles higr er up gave us the proper direction, and we made good progress, though we had to plod along knee-deep in snow. A cold wind now began to blow over the pass, and quickly dissi pated the morning mists ; but the temperature was too low to be plpasant, even tbough the sun was shining. Our attention was riv*tted on our mountain, now rising sheer above us. 'From some points of view we thought an ascent practicable, from others the precipices looked more difficult, and at length, after changing our opinion several time 3, we came to the con clusion that it would all depend upon the nature of the rock. Neither of us had any experience of granite mountains, but coming up the Clinton Valley we had noticed that nearly all the rock walls of the mountains were steep and slippery, and for the most part destitute of hand or foot holds. Besides, what we thought from the Mintaro camp to be a narrow arete leading up to the peak, now proved to be a series of precipices and ledges covered with vegetation and snow. The arete proper seemed farther round, but such is the peculiarity of the mountain that this apparent arete also, on subsequent inspection, resolved itself into a similar series of precipices. But what most enchained our attention now was tha view from the saddle. It more than exceeded our expectations, and challenged com parision with anything we had ever seen. We had each of us been on higher peaks than any surrounding us, and had feasted our eyes on the wonders 01 scenery more truly alpine — nob'er mountains and greater glaciers and snow fields ; but the wild and rugged grandeur of our present surroundings was unique. The blackness of the mountain walls, the narrowness of the valleys, and above all the nearness of the views, charmed and surprised us. In the valley up which we had journeyed the mountain ranges ro-e above the mists. Deep down below us wa- Like Mintaro with the lonely hut. Turnirjg to the right we Baw tbe long ridge of Mount Hart, leading to a fine rock peak, and beyond it the glacier behind Mount Sutherland that feeds the Sutherland Falls, just tipped by the morning sun. Down the Arthur Valley range after range, streaked with snow, rose clear cnt againit a blue sky merging near the horizon into pale green ; while right opposite the pass— the grandest and most striking night of all was Mount Elliot, with the pretty little Jervoia glacier stretching between its twin peaks. The sun just tipped a patch of snow on tbe left of either peak, while the glacier itself and the stupendous black precipices flanking Roaring creek were in shadow. Two streams of frozen mow clung to fhe rocks below the higher end of the glacier, and, still further round, a peculiar cleft in the rock ran down slantwise from near the summit to the shoulder of the mountain for fully 1000 ft. Occasionally a block of ice fell from the edge of the glacier, or a rock avalanche rattled down sheer into the valley thousand 1 ) of feet below. Mount Balloon rose on the right, but in point of grandeur and beauty it was not to be compared to Mount Elliot, the black precipices of which stood out in vivid contrast against the foreground of snow which the saddle this day afforded. Indeed, this mountain we thought as pretty an alpine picture as we had ever seen. From a climber's point of view, too, Elliot pro mised to be a tougher customer than Balloon — at all events, from this aide, his beetling precipices seemed quite inaccessible. It was our intention, after exploring for a route on Mount Balloon, to bivouac for the night on the saddle, but it was so cold, and there was so much snow about, that we now gave up the idea. I stopped for a minute or two to take a photograph of Fvfe on the saddle, and then we hurried on along the pass to a big rock, under the lee side of which we got shelter from the cold wind. Here, after wringing out our stockings, we left our swags, and, taking only our ice axes and the alpine rope, we went straight for the precipices of Mount Balloon. We kicked steps up a snow-filled couloir and then sidled up the precipices, climbing townrds what appeared to be an arete running down into the valley at the head of Roaring creek. We got on very well for a while, but the lun began to get round on to our side of the mountain, and, melting the snow, made the rocks slip pery, and the vegetation in the crevices and on the ledges dripping wet, so ' that we had to exercise more than usual care. The heat of the sun, moieover began to loosen the frozen snow on the ledges or a precipice that towered above us for nearly 1000 ft, and misses came crushing down in unpleasant proximity. In nearly every case, however, the falling piices became so dicintf grated through coining from such a great height that there was little or no danger, and we proceeded. We had no inten tion of making the accent this day, bo we climbed independently, trying the rocks in different dire -tions. F>fe almost got stuck on a difficult bit of the cliff near the head of the couloir, and had to leave his axe behind. The couloir narrowed as we proceeded, furtively glancing up every now and then at the chunks of frozen snow that came whizzing down from the heights above. Some of the chips occa sionally struck us, and the fusillade was becom ing just a little unpleasnnt, when suddenly there was a craph above, and we saw, descend ing from a great he gilt, a larger mass than any that had preceded it. We instinctively ducked our heads into the snow as the falling mass struck the edge of the couloir above us a little to the right, and came swishing down the slope in _ a thousand pieces. This was hardly good enough, so, recognising thah discretion was the better part of valour, we turned and beat a precipitate retreat. We th >ught it was just possible that the mountain might be climbed by these preci pices, but until the snow melted we recognised that the route would not be a safe one. We had further evidence of this a few minutes later, for as we were glissading down the couloir a chip of rock came whizzing past us, too close to be pleasant. Fyfe ""Vent down first, and was skirting the base of the first great precip cc that rises from the saddle on the Milford side, when there was a crash above. I yelled to him to look out, but he had seen the rock coming, and in a moment had ducked bis head down and his heels up the slope, bo that if the rock did strike him it wowld not be in a vulnerable part. To me, looking down from a height of 200 ft or 300fr, the attitude he prenfiit-d was most comical, and although I could not but recognise the danger and admire his quickness aud presence of mind, I could not at the same time refrain from laughing aloud. The rock fell within half a dozen yards of him and buried itself in the snow. In the present state of the mountain, the route we had chosen was evidently not a practicable one. Two or three alternative routes, however, remained, and as Kenneth would now be back at the Miutaro hut, wo decided to re turn there, and mike an early start on the morrow with a view to attacking the peak from the saddle on the Clinton side. On the sunny sido of the mountain where we had been climbing, we were out of the wind, and it was delightfully warm, but now that we reached the summit of the pass agaiD, late in the after noon, we seemed in a few strides to have stepped from a temperate to an Antarctic clime, so cold and bitter was the keen wind that blew over the pass. Nevertheless, I halted to take a few photographs, and Fjfe went on, as he dreaded an attack of neuralgia. The sun still shone on the pass, and I jras able to secure exce'knt photographs of Mount Hart, Mount Elliot, and the Jervois glacier. The mist swirling over the lower end of the saddle hid the shoulder of Mount Hart, and the final peak towering above the mist was remarkably im posing. All the same it was too cold to remain long in such an exposed position, so putting my camera together as quickly as my numbed fingers would permit, I hurried over the pass and down the bush track to a more congenial clime. Our party, which at the Lake Te Anau hut numbered a dozen, was now scattered over several miles of Fiordland. Fyfe and I were on the pass ; my wife was at the Mintaro hut ; Hodgkins, Ziele, and my two brothers were swagging up the Clinton Valley from the half way hut; the artist, the doctor, and his wife were cruising with the captain and the engineer in one of the distant fiords of Te Anau ; and the quide — whose assistance in swagging would have been most valuable— was idly kicking his heels in Milford Sound, awaiting our arrival in the Government steamer which came not at all. We spent the night in the Mintaro hut, and next morning the whole party started over the pasa, Kenneth and I going on ahead with the intention of trying the aficent of Mount Bslloon by way of the arere and the precipices leading to the saddle. We ascended the buah path in the mist cud climbed bo the paßo, when • regular blizzard was in fall blase* The AlpfiHt rope which Fyfe had left on the previous enreift Ing was frozen hard to one of the snow pole#i and the mitt was so thick that it' was dimonlQ to keep the right direction, the path bßingf covered with snow and the snow poles frequently invisible in the fog. Just after reaching tha highest point of the pass, however, we suddenly reached the edge of the mist, and walked Intel Bupshine. The view of Mount Elliot, the Jew vois glacier, and the peaks on the Milford siewj burst upon us with 1 o startling a suddennesi that it seemed for a moment unreal. The tod&f pinnacles of Mount Harb towered high abova the mist on the left, and the ollffs of Balloon, the Sentinel of the Bmjs,, rose abruptly on ttte right. The precipices up which we' proposed ta climb were swept by the full force, of the wind*. I saw that we should ba frozen if we attempted an ascent in that direction j so, not giving tha route a second thought, F led round on thd sheltered side of the peak and, aacendiug tt short snow couloir to the root of one of thtj precipices, to the left of where Fyfe and I had been climbing the previous day, I waited fos Kenneth to come up; We made slow progress^ as the vegetation, which seems to grow any,* where and everywhere in this region, wnfl drip* ping wet, and in consequence as slippery as glass. The rock* were also wet, except where in places they actaally overhung, and hand and foot holds were few and far but ween. We got on fairly well, however, till we o&ma to a narrow ledge midway between two precipices. It was covered with wet and slippery grass? and a fall meant a drop of several hundred feet. Kenneth crawkd round it on hands and knees, and I followed, but, not liking the look of things, thought it wise to baot a retreat; Leaving Hodgkins to take some photographs and the other* to proceed down to the Beeoti huts on the Milford side, Kennoth and I resolved to have another ""«hot""at tha peakj; so, skirting round the precipices on the Milford side, we made our way, but not without difficulty, to the head of Roaring creek. Tha weather bow became threatening, and a bank of mist came twirling over the range at the head of the gorge and curled round like »n inverted point of interrogation ru'.o the valley. Aa occasional avalanche from the Jervois glaoiety now close above us on the lefts, woke the echoes. There w&a a gratt variety of alpine plants in the valley, and at it* head a series of waterfalls came down over the precipices. We climbed for about 1000 ft, but the mists came over thicker than ever and hid the peak. Wo waited for half an hour in the cold wind in hopes that it would clear, and at last got a view of the peak above tho pass and the highec crags beyond. Mount Balloon is generally depicted as a peak, bub it is in reality only the end of a long ridge running a considerable distance back, and curving round the west branch of the Clinton river in a south-easterly direction. As the clouds lifted momentarily, we could ses our route, except in one p»rt, aim >*t to the sunimifc. If Balloon was to be climbed at all, evidently this was the way to tacklo him, and we felt con fident of success. To attempt the final portion of the ascent no* was, however, out of tha question, as the day was wearing on and the weather was threatening. Moreover, we had bigger fish to fry. Tutoko, over 9000 ft high— the monarch of the Milford region,— was waiting to be conquered ; so we turned our fac»« southward, resolving to interview Mount Balloon again on our return journey. The altitude of M'Kinnon's Pass is given on the official maps as 2400 ft, Lake Minfctro 1950 ft, and the Beech huts 840 ft, while Mouufc Balloon is supposed to be 7000 ffc high. Thero is, however, something wrong here, as it will be evident to any mountaineer used to ganging the height of mountains that Balloon p»ak does not rise 4600 ft above the pass. It is plain, too, that the pass is more than 450 ft above Lake Mintaro. I had no opportunity of taking proper barometrical data on thin trip, as one journeys over the pans were so hurried ; but on three occasions I took readings on top of the pass and found that my aneroid registered 3400 ft, wh'ch I should judge to be pretty near 9 correct estimate of the height. After leaving the saddle the track windt tot a few hundred yards down grassy slopes and enters the bush, which here grows luxuriantly, high up on the mountain slopes. The path then follows the couree of Roiring creek to the Beech huh?, which are situated in a small clearing about a mile from the Sutherland Falls. We found the downward track very Bloppy, owing to the newly melted snow, and arrived at the hut* at dusk, rather tired with the swagging and the difficult scrambling we had had on Mount Balloon. The others, including my wife, had made splendid time from Mintaro, especially considering that they had to fight their >vay over the pass in a regular blizzard, and that it was not easy work tramp ing through the snow which still coy- red the pass. We found a hot meal awaiting our arrival, and a cheery fire blazing in the log chimneys of both huts — which, by the way, were in rather a dilapidated condition. And here it might nob be out of place to say that the hubs a'ong this route are a disgrace to wb< 1 ever is responsible for looki g after i-hem. Those ab the head of the lak-s and fhe half way camp are not so bad, bub there is much to be desired in connection with the hub at Miutaro and the Beech huts. Where we were now camped my wife and I occupied the hut reserved for ladies. We found cracks an inch wide in (he walls and the floor, and dniing the night the rats, with which most of the huts are infested, scampered over our bunks and made desperate efforts to gtt a* our provisions. What is wanted along this truck are huts built of corrugated iron and lined with Willesden roofing paper, like the Ball Glacier hufc ab Mount Cook. As is the case there alco, zinc lined boxes should be provided for blankets and provisions, which would thus be safe from the ravages of the rats. It was no uncommon thing tor us to have to g""t up several times during the night to ecare the rats away. Hammock beds would also be a great improvement, both in point of comfort and cleanliness, upon the pre sent bunks with their mattresses of loose fern, which as often as not has been all used np for fire kindling. A second hut is badly needed at the end of Lake Te Anau, bat no doubt before long there will be an accommodation house there. It is also highly desirable that a hut should be erected near the saddle, as time can be very profitably spent there botanising, sketch ing, photographing, and climbing. From a hut situated on the pass the ascent of Mount Hart could be made even by ladies, and tourists would be able to spend more time amongst the most interesting and wonderful scenery on the overland trip, instead of, as they often do now, hurry past it at midday, tired and weary, and as often as not scarcely getting a glimpse of it, owing to bad weather. The man who agitates in this matter and succeeds in getting the Government to build a hut on th« pass will deserve well of his country and tha tourists who proceed overland from Te Anau to Milford. The people of New Zealand as a whole ara not lovers of scenery. Probably, as mnst inevitably happens in a new country, they think more of business, grain-growing, and sheep* raising. The late Judge Bathgate use to tell • fiaty of how on one occasion when he was vititfag m well-to-do Blieepfanner in the interior, ho sat for an hoar or more in the evening feasting his soul on the beauties of a sunset behind the mountain ranges visible from the verandah of the homestead. His meditations were broken iil upon by the appearance on the icene of bis host, to whom he remarked, ""Man, what splendid scenery you have here !"" to which came the laconic reply, ""Aye, but I'm thinking the feed's a bit bare the noo ! "" And this seems the general spirit pervading the Siople in the country districts of New Zealand, utton is the gcd they worship most, and the poets and painters that Sir George Grey as eured a Loudon audience the other day would be born of New Zealand's eceaic grandeur remain so far amongst the "" unborn millions."" But there can be no doubt that the natural wonders of Maoriland are amongst her most valuable assets, and that some day she will jeap from this source a harvest rich enough to pay the interest on her nat : onal debt. Aud this same overland trip to Te An an is one of the asseis that is most in need of develop ment. --The scenery cannot ba surpassed in the whole world ; the flora and the fauDa are most interesting ; the rivers are stocked with trout ; and it only wants the intro duction of chamois or red deer to make it a sportsman's paradise. We can only hope that the Seddon Administration, which has already done gcod work in opening up out of the way places for tourist traffic, will .continue here £he good work they have done in other 1 directions. Much could still be done to popu larise this excursion. The latter portion of the coach road from the Mararoa liver to Lake -- Te Anau. is greatly, in want of improvement. If the telephone were taken as f*r a? Te Anau, it , would also greatly; facilitate tourist traffic. It : -is » pity, too, that the Otago School Commts . Bioners, who own. tho land at To Anau, cannot * see their way to assist in the irrig'.tiou of the * land in the vicinity of the township. The cost of irrigation would be small, and there is * abundant evidence that with a good water supply Te Anau could be made a fertile and mqch more .picturesque: spot than it i« at pre ssnt. These and other improvements will, how ever, no doubt come in time, and (lieu the over land trip will be m&de, not by hundreds, but by thousands annually.

143,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,70,"THURSDAY, AUGUST 1.","In the Legislative Council this afernoon the Dunedin D:a""mage Bill paseed through Com mittee, the Commisf ioners* Powers Bill and Cpmetery (Cremation) Bill were finally paseed, and Borne progress made with the Property Law Consolidation Bill. This afternoon was devoted to the bills of private members in the House of Representa tives. The O^go Dock Amendment Bill and the Hawksbury Borough Council Bill were among the bills passed in the after noon, bub the Wellington Streets Bill was thrown out. The evening was devoted to Committee work, and the Threshing Machine Owners' Lien, Criminal Code Amendment, Coal Mines, and Counties- Act Amendment Bills were finally passed. Ministers, esp-cially ths Treasurer and Minister for Lunds, oppo'ed the Defamnt'on Bill to H'uiongly that this measure, which is in force iv Qu-t inland, was finally thrown out. CDAL MINES The Coal Mines Act Amendment Bill was committed, the amendments made by the Gold fields Committee agreed to, and the clauses passed with amendments. Mr G. W. RUSSELL moved a new clause to the effect that any laud known to contain coai shall ba set aside as a coal reserve, and worked by the State as a national coil mine, the coal therefrom to be used as the Mioister for Mines m*y direct, either on railways or for other public purposes. The Hon., Mr SBDDON objected to such a clauße,beiog inserted in a bill of thia kind. The motion was loh+ fey 38 h> 14. COUNTIES BILL. The Counties Act Amendment Bill was committed. Mr J. W. KELLY moved a new clause to the effect that in case of any new road district lapsing such road district shall merge into the county in which it is situated. — Agreed to, and the remaining clausps passed. DEFAMATION. The Defamation Bill was committed. The Hou. Mr WARD moved that the short title be amended so as to make ib a Defamation of Public Men Bill. He said if the bill pissed in its present form it would give opportunity to unscrupulous jour nalists to attack pubic men. He said there were a few journalists in the colony who were by no means fair in their criticism. He did not objest to fair criticism at all, but he did objecb to scurrilous attacks on the parb of certain newspapers, and he hoped the Committee would agree to his amendment. He thought that it was very unfortunate that public men should be subjected to such attacks -as were sometimes made on there by some newspapers in this colony, and if this bill were passed' no man in the Honse would be saf«. ► Sir R. STOUT asked what clause the Tren surer objected to. - The Hon. Mr WARD said he objected to the whole of the bill. Sir R. STOUT then moved that the Chair msn leave the chair on the bill. The Hon. Mr WARD agreed to that, and moved nccordingly. Sir R STOUT *aid Mr Ward had adopted a most extraordinary attitude over this bill. If the Treasurer objected to the bill he should have the manlintss to do so on the second read ing so that his remarks might be recorded in Hansard. Some of the clauses so strongly ob jected to by Mr Ward were actually the law .at preient, and were merely declaratory. The Treasurer bad condemned certain news paper?, but the Government had actually taken the Government advertisements from the most respectable papers in the colony and givou them to the most scurrilous papers in New Zealand. He defended the bill at some length, and said it chit fly related to protection ia reporting matters of public interest and publishing fair comment on public questions. He (Sir R. Stout) considered the press of this colony was conducted better, on the whole, than the press of London He was surprised at who called themselves Liberals, and who spoke about the freedom of the press, objecting to this bill. The Hon. J. M'K^NZIE supported the motion that the Chairman leave the chair. He said he considered the papers so much praised by Sir R. Stout were just as scurrilous as those he condemned. After a lengthy debate the motion that the Chairman leave the ohair was carried by 32 to 20, and the bill was thus thrown out. JOTTINGS. Mr Heke, in urging the establishment of an agricultural and technical college for Maoris, said that a young Maori had became head of a tailoring e.-tablißhtnent, several bad become carpenters, some had learned saddlery, and large numbers went out to work on farms and runs to learn how to work their own lands. He arged that facilities be given for teaching the' boys how to utilise their lands when they grew up.' The Miirsfcer for Education said the Government could not start a college, but if Te Aute College or St. Stephen's School would take the matter up the Government would co operate. It is the intention of the Government to put the Local Government Bill through this session. It is now in type, but awaiting final revision by the Cabinet. It consolidate and repeals over 50 existing acts, and is largely on the lines indi cated by the Premier on the West Coast and to the county council deputation. In Committee on the Otago Dock Bill this afternoon the overdraft clause was amended to prevent the trust having a larger overdraft at tbe end of the year than the amount of revenue that may be outstanding. The powers to con struct warehouses or storehouses other than cool stores and sheds was struck out, and money that may be borrowed on debentures is not to bear higher interest than 5 per cent. The Waite Lands Committee have no recom mendation to make as to the petition praying for a revaluation of the Poinahaka estate. The Petitions Committee recommend the petition of the Women's Christian Temperance Union for the establishment of inebriate homes to the Government for favourable consideration. The Government intend to go in for forest planting th's year. The Nat've owners of the Wairarapa. Likes are again bringing the questions in dispute regarding them before the House.

Limited, report per San Fran cisco mail, under date October 2nd : During the first three weeks under re view, the weather was very wet, stormy, and unfavorablo to the trade generally, and the demand for all classes of meat was slow and dragging. Large supplies of chilled beef have been selling at very low prices, while game and rabbits, which have been unusually cheap and plentiful, have helped to curtail the consumption of meat. Frozen meat shared in the general depression, lambs and forequarters of beef especiallyselling at less moriey. Tlmweek, however, withscool, fine weather, trade has improved, and firmer prices are ob« tainable all round. The agricultural returns for this year show an increase in the United Kingdom of about 1,000,000 sheep and 119,000 cattle, as compared with 1895. There la still a deficiency, however, as compared with the returns of 1891, 1892, and 1893. There appears every prospect of keep being good and plentiful during the winter. Frozen Mutton.—Arrivals from New Zealand comprise about 90,000 carcases* Up to the current week values of all classes, with the exception of best Oanter burys, ruled slightly in buyers' favot, really good bright sheep of the latter class being scarce and rather firmer. A number of damaged North Island sheep, selling at low prices, quit 9 prevented holders from raising values of secondary grades. Latterly the reduced supplies are be ginning to be felt, and a firmer tone has supervened, quotations marking an ad vance on the month. About 60,000 car cases have come to hand from Australia. Prices of these have ruled weak, and lasb month's quotations are still current. Frozen Lamb. Arrivals from New Zealand comprise about 15,000 carcases. Prices shew a further decline. The de mand is becoming very limited, and Home-killed lambs are in full supply, and selling at low rates. Frozen Beef.—New arrivals have been about 31,500 quarters from Australia, and 600 quarters from New Zealand.

223,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,150,THE FANCIERS' CLUB SHOW.,"(Special Comments for the Witness.) By Black-bed. The annual show of the Danedin Fanciers' Club was held in the Garrison Hall on Friday and Saturday laßt, the entries of poultry num bering 539, with very few empty pens, while pigeons filled 201 pens. The game classes, excepting black reds, were rather disappointing this year, some varieties having no entry and others one and two only. In black-reds Mr \V. M'Ewen took first for old cocks with a very fair, all-round bird ; second going to Mr Murdoch for a large, reachy speci men ; third prize, Aitken and Son, for a nicely-coloured cock, too long in hackle, and coarse in head. The first-prize old hen is of good size and shape, rather light iv colour ; the second has g >otl re-ich and colour, but is twisted in cjmb; ttiird, excellent colour, fine reach, and might have been bigh-r in the prize list. Cockerel* — First prize too high in tail, other wise a fair, all-round bird of a nice colour ; second, too dark in colour ; third, better in head pro perties than any in the -class ; pen No. 14 (un noticed) contained an undubbed bird of pro mising stamp. First pr!za in pullets went' to a very stylish bird with a capital head and good reach ; second also a nice bied. bub too coatao in comb. The two brown red cockerels were coarse-, and too dark in hack'e. Pullets of this variety had only two entries, neither being of high merit. In the remaining olasses of other coloured game the only bird showing hign quality was the duokwing hen of Messrs Aitken and Son, whioh took first in her class. Whites were only fair. INDIAN GAME. \ The two classes provided for Indian game were fairly well filled, there betas seven entries in the cook or cockerel class, vR- eight- hens oc pullets in the female clais. Mr Sydney James took first with a fair cockerel w»nting sfee ; second was too he*vy in tail, and might have changed places wi-h the tbird prize, which was much bettor in thin respect. The best bodied bird of tho lot was No. 53 (Watson), spoilt by being dabbed. In hens or pullets Mr Watson took tint with a good-bodied hen, but Bob the right coloured legs; secrad (Hill), a capital pullet. About the beat in the class was a pullet shown by Mr Hill, quite a typioal bird, but overlooked by the judges. Two fair Malays were shown by Mr Of. W. Barker, who had no rival. GAME BANTAMS. Black reds in aU oluaes wore of high quality; Mr Hart's old cook ' won , easily, the same exhibitor taking first in hens, with Mr R. Watson a good cecond. All the exhibits in this class showed high quality. In cockerels Sir B. Gall had a olesr win with a charming little bird ; second a nice reachy cooker*!, and third a fair bird, very neat. A good pair of pullets shown by Mr Bart made up the next clais, and there was not much to choose between th<tm. Brown reds numbered 14 in all clashes, but were a long way behind the black reds in point of quality, Mr Skcne'fl pullet (taking 'first in her class) being an exception. She is very 5m.%11 and neat, and has a good gipsy face. A vice pair of pile h ns w ro shown, the firifc prize wanting a little more colour. The cockerel was also a fair specimen. All the piles cams from Mr Hart's yards. With the exception of the first-prize winners the duckwing classes showed no great merit. Iv bantams — not game — Messrs. Ai'.keu and Son showed two good white-booted, and a nice Fekiu got a second prize. HAMBURG. In golden-penoilled cockerels Mr lUukin won easily in a cI«S3 of two. The pens containing the pullets were in a bad light for judging. Mr W. H. Wilson took first aud second iv a clais of thre«. In gold spangles (h«nR or. pullets) Messrs Maokie and Co took fits';, tec<md, and h.c. witti good birds, Mr James Johnston being third. Silver-pencilled hens or pullets had only two entries of medium quality. Silver spangles were more numerous and of bettsr quality, Mr C A. Thompson taking first and Mr* Dow second with good birds. In hens Mr. G. S. Jones secured first; and second with a pair of first- -.Us •> birds, and Mr W. H. Wilson third, the while cla-s being go d. Iv cockerels first prize was far and away best in head and comb, but not so taking in mark ings as the second prize. In pullets Mr James Geddes had an easy win. In point of quality blacks were excellent. Mr G. S. Jonei got firat in hens, Mr Bisset second, and Mr T. R. Cunningham third. In cockerels flr*t prizs if takun by Mr J. Parker with a particularly nice bird -capital head, cimb, and lobes, and good lustre; second is good, but far behind the winner. Pullets were a good lot and well judged. PLYMOUTH. ROCKS. Mr H. Mtjyes took first in tojks with a nicely marked bird, rather wanting in size ; second wai larger, but not s-o wi-11 marked ; third might h-vc. been a step higher on the lint. In hana Mr Cox bad a clear -win ; second was too light in leg colour ; third, bttter legs, not no well marked as second. In cockerels Mr Cox was again well in frout of his competitors. The two pullt-ts fthowu were not first class. BPANISH. In old cocks Mr S in -'a first prize bird had a clear win. Mr R s«'b old hen, taking first, is a capital hen and is a long way in front, the third prize rimn'ng the second very ha«d. In c -ckerels the judging was rather hard to follow. Mr Rose's first prize had the longest face, but is faulty in comb and not so smooth in fiiue as he should be ; seond prize, comb falls badly and is rough in face; third has a better comb an') good smooth ftcc. About the be»t bird after tbe winner is Mr Fleming's h.c, No. 182. In pullets tbe first (Mr A. G. EunU) ia a. good b jdied pullet, with a fair face ; second and t,hird (Mr J Ruse) are small, bub better in face than first. Taking tbe Spanish on the whole they were a vory good lot. LEGHORNS. f Leghorns were the utrongt'st classes in point of number in the show and the qualry w*» good all round. In the cock class Sir A. Miller had first with a very clear win ; etcoud was bigger, but wanting the quility of the wirtning bird. In hens Mr lanes scored with an old hea in the pink of condition ; second was very clone up, aud third a nice hen but small. In cockerel* Mr A Miller came first with a bird well shown ; seconO, Mr Matthews, so near the winner bbab ib w*n a toss-np between teem ; third, Mr Condon, too light iv leg colour. In pullets Mr Dougherty took first with a small specimen, but quite good enough to take the first place in a good c!a>s ; Mr Miller's eerond-prize pullet is bigger, but not so good in the comb ; third prize was small and neat ; Ms Hnmil'on's h c. pull«t hts » squired tail, which spoils an otherwise good specimen. In brown cocks the prize-winner* were well selected, Mr Dougherty's exhibit wiuning from a good bird shown by Mr Eauis, who had second. Iv hens the flrsb was or excellent colour and a loag way ahead of the others. In a capital lot of cockerels Mr Duugharoy took first and second place; third priz-j was a good bird, but on the guaall side. Mr Dougherty's firfct prize bird was claimed, and i« che^p at the catalogue price. In pullets Mr Richards to«k first with one of good size, very well grown in deed ; second and third small, but very neat and good. I-ANGSHANS. In cocks first took his place with ease ; second too small. In hens Messrs Double Brothers gob first and second — almost a match. Cockerels had six entries. First was a big bird, but not shown in so good a condition as the second, which had a beautiful lustre. The eight entries in the pullet clais were all well shown, Messrs Double Brothers again icor ing first place. HOUDANS. This breed was sparse in number and poor in quality, first and second in the hen class being the best. POLISH. In golden Polish Messrs Aitken and Son had things all their own way with a nice team of birds, their third-prize hen having the best crest. In silver! the same exhibitors divided the prizes with Mrs Wttlis and Mr G. Ander son. Four white-crested, shown by Mems Aitken, had no rivals — an unfortunate circum stance, as they would have taken some beating. In plain Polish the quality wa« medium, the first-prize hen being the best of the lot. BBAHMAfI. Only two dark cocks were shown, tke firol IRinning well. In light Brabmas the number of •nfaries and quality of exhibits were an improve ment on the dark olasses. First and second prize old .cooks were good birds, but the hens beat the cook in quality. Mr John Fraser took first in all four classes, the three pullets being exceptionally good. DOEKING3. Tno fair old hens were shown in the cl&sses for (larks, with not much between them in merit. Cockerels mustered, well in number— first and second pretty close, the first having the better legs ; third wan « nice, compact bird. Mr G. Batcher, of Christchurch, took first with a .par ticularly nice pullet"", second was bigger in frame, but not so food in leg colour. Moat of the pullets' legs were inclined to be sooty. Tho Silver dorkingcock anditensot MrW. H. Muyes, of Milton, were quite the piok of the dockings in all classes, and would hold their own in Strong competition. COCHINS, la buff or cinnamon cocks Messrs Banks, of Christchurch, repeated their Wellington triumph, taking first and second wi'h a pair of grand birds, Messrs Aitken and Son beiug close up with a firdt-class cock, the same exhibitors also getting h.c. for another good bird. In hens, cockerels, and pullets Mesers Banks secured all the firsts, with Messrs Aitken and Son again in near attendance, Mr S. S. Myers taking third in hens. Partridges made a grand show, all the first prizes but one being-secured by Messrs Aitken and Son, their old cock being about the best of ihe variety ever seen in Duoedin. In old cocks Mr S. S. Myers took second, and Mr H. Buck land third. In hens Messrs Aitken secured all the awards. For cockerels Messrs Aitken had first with a -promising yonDgster, Mrs Willis second, and Mr Symirgbbn tbiid. In pallets Me»nrs Aitken were beaten for first place by Mr Symington, but got second aud third. White cochins were not a high class The cochins all through, with the exception of the whites, were a grand lot, and quite a feature of the show. WTANDOTTES. The first-prize old cock was a good one^ — biittvr in lacing and clearer in colour than his sole opponent. Hens were good, first ptize going to a beauty shown by Mr Field. The Becoud and third prizes in this class were secured ""by Mr Sydney James with a particularly nice ""pwr. The priz r s for cockerels were well placed, the first being neat in hetd and nicely ■laced 1 ; the second was on the small side. In pullets the first was very neat and well marked ; seeend better sized, but not bo good iv other respects as the winner. -• , The goldens contained some birds of high merit, and the prizes were placed with the right birds. Some nice whites were shown. ANDALUSIANS. This beautiful variety was well represented, the quality of the exhibits this year being very high class. Messrs Banks, of Chri&tchurch, took first and second with a pair of grand hens. They also took' first and third in pullats, Mr Watson, of Tituaru, taking second. The best AndttluHHn in the show, however, was Messrs B*nks'« first-prize cockerel, whioh is a gem of the first -water. The pullets were again a beautiful lot and well judged. MINOECAS. Mr Rowan tnkes first ia old cocks with a ster ling good bird ; a clear trio. For heus Messrs Aitken beat the owner of the first old cock with a very nice hen, Mr R. Innes coming third. For cockerels Mr Rjwan got first with a bird in capital condition, but this bird was very clo.ely run by the second prize, belonging to the same owner. The class was a strong one for quality, tonsequently the win was a meritorious one. The first-priza bird was claimed at catalogue price. Pullets formed a capital class, Mr Innes taking first with a gem in point of conditiou aud quality - second and third being good ova in •pite of the loss of a toenail by the third prize. WATER FOWL. Two fine pair of geese were shown, and Messrs BinVs had a pair of particularly fine Ajlo-bary ducks. The same exhibitors also beat Mr Orbtll in Rouens. Pekina seemed the favoured variety, and made a good show, Messrs Whittaker and Sydney James dividing the prizes. In conclusion, it may be stated that tbe judg ing in the poultry classes left little to be de wed, and grumblers were few and far between.",0,-2.670619533,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colonel Harrington nxade a minute inspection of the arm*, accoutrements, and clothing Captain Andrew then handed over command to Lieut VTurray, who put the companies through the manual ami platoon exetcises. Captain Andrew then drilled the companies, the movements being ordered by Colonel Har rington The Inspecting Officer addressed the companies, to the effect that the} were a fine body of men, and that he was very thankful for their attendance at drill, knowing the very great inconvenience they were put to at this season of the year, and so soon after the serious floods. He trusted they would continue to keep up the volun tßer movement. The Otago men had been pre-eminent for their good shooting, and he hoped some day the volunteers in the North Island would excel in the vs 3 of the rifle. The Inspector again complimented them on their steadiness and appeara ice. Five men ; were then picked to fire at the rifla range. On. Tuesday last, the Annual Inspection of this Company was held by Colonel Har rington in the recreation ground.

Captain Jones then took com mand and after proving the company, put them through company and infantry drill Afterwards the men were thrown out in skirmishing order, and the various move ment s connected therewith were gon through with a few very trifling mistakes. The 'whole"" turn, out and the various inoveme .ts were good, and when Colonel Harrington addressed the company he expressed himself as much pleased w : th it. He sud he knew that they had had great difficulties to con tend with in the way of proper drill instructors, and that great credit was due to the officers of the company for its proficiency. He was well satisfied with their appearance, but would like to impress on them the necessity of preserving strict silence and m-der in the ranks. Colonel Harrington selected 6 men on parade for Rifle practice on the following morning. Three cheers were then given for the Colonel, and a hearty one for Captain Atkinson.

34,1870-01-19,BH,Bruce Herald,11,LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS.,"The price of the 41b loaf in Melbourne is 6d. It is reported that Mr Fifczherbert is about to leave the colony on a two years' visit to England. The Glassblowers have been giving entertain ments in Ohristchuroh, where a local paper sayi they had ""a perfect crush of patrons."" Governor Bowen, Lady Bowen, and Mr M'Lean visited the Thames Goldh'elds on the 11th. An Auckland contemporary understands that ! the sum of L 52,00» was paid into the Provincial I Treasury recently by the General Government, being the amount if refund of interest and sink ""ing fund due to that province. Four companies of the 13th Regiment left Auckland for Australia, by H.M.S. Virago, on Friday. The Taranaki detachment leaves by the Claud Hamilton, for Melbourne, on the 18th. The Kosuriois ordered to take the Napier and Wanganui detachments to Auckland. For he situation of Schoolmaster for Feather ston School, North Island, salary L 125 a year, ! there were 12 applications. These were frcm i all sorts of characters, some who had never been to school themselves, some whose letters were uugrammatical &c, &c, presenting a curious medley of ignorance and impudence. A memorial is in course of signature, praying his Honor the Superintendent for the immediate construction of a draw-bridge over the Shotover, at Arthur's Point. ThiHon. Mr Tollemache is about to re-visit the colony, accompanied by Mrs Tollemuche. Their names appear in the passenger list of the Wild Duck, which left London for Wellington on the 2nd October. A fatal accident has occured at Sowburn, to a man named Thomas Henry Morrican, who, while in search of cattle was thrown from his hT3e. He was seen to fall, and was conveyed to the Sowburn store, where he expired in about half- an -hour after his arrival. A man named Wiliamson, while working at the Gentle Annie, recently fell from a considerable height, and sustained a frightful scalp wound, the scull being laid bare. \ We -observe a man named Saunders, ""the Wizard of the east "" has been, indulging in tricks of a rather practical character in the North Island He has in several places advertised wonderful entertainments, got crowded houses, the entrance money being of course paid at the door, and after pocketing the amount the anount the Wizard suddenly became invisible. The remains of Mr James M. Balfour were picked up on the beach about a mile north of Timaru, on the Bth instant. They were brought to Dunedin, and, in accordance with the desire of Mrs Balfour, were buried on Saturday last, alongside the body of his old friend and school fellow Mr Paterson. Mrs Balfour, wiow of the late Mr James M. Balfour, Marine Engineer, has returned t> her friends in England. She left Wellington on Sunday week, by the ship Halcione. j A correspondent in another column makes a i very good suggestion as to the Volunteer Band coming out on Saturday evening. We hope to see it carried out, as we quite agree to the en livening effect it would produce upon our streets. The late flood was severely felt at Clyde, where the whole valley was one broad sheet of water, and many gardans, &c, were de stroyed. A sensational paragraph has gone the round to credulous portions of the press, to ! the effect that a woman had been seen on the Kaikoras with a loaded revolver in one hand, and carrying under her other arm one of her children with its throat cut. The same i. now proved to be a hoax. By the upsetting of a boat recently at Waiwera. Auckland, a Mrs Hanlen, Mr Fit ford, and a baby have been drowned. There were in all, eight, persons in the boat which ! upset as one of the men was stepping into it. Five were rescued by another boat at a little distance. The three bodies were found shortly afterwards, the baby being fast locked in the arms of Mrs Hanlen. In a circular issued from the General Post-office, and dated Jan. 1, postmasters are informed that on and after the first day January, 1870, the colonial tee on registered letters, packets, &c, for places beyond the colony will be reduced from one shilling to sixpence. As to the beneficial results expected at once to follow the recent action of the Provincial Council of Otago a..d Southland in the matter of re-union, the 'Weekly News' says: — ""We may reasonably expect to hear shortly of some thing having been done by the joint action of the respective governments, tc wards thd relief of those pressing necessities that were — if not the source of the agitation for re-union — made use of as unanswerable arguments by the local advocates of the movement. The public were led to believe that on the acceptance of the terms by Otago, the requisite representations would be made to the . General Government to obtain an advance from the Colonial Treasury of sufficient amount to meet the "" floating.lia bilities ""of this province. These, it is almost unnecessary to say, include official salaries, tradesmen's accounts, &c, &c, the withholding of which has undoubtedly caused great incon venience, and in the opinion of many, done much to bring about a feeling of general depres sion."" The latest news regarding Te Kooti is unsatis factory, but contradictory It is said he is sup posed really to be in the Upper Thames country ; it is certain he is not at Tokangamutu. Also, that the Waikatos are assembling a large body of men there; one report says to intercept Topia, another to protect Te Koo i, who wishes to settle down quietly, while a third affirms their object to be the capture of Te Kooti. Col. M'Donnell. has been ordered round to the head of Taupo lake, in order to get between Tokangamutu and the Upper. Thames. ' A crisis is. evidently ap proaching, and considerable anxiety is felt. Another account siys that. — Upon Topia reach ing Tauinaranui. the King party offered to pro tect Te Kooti If he would place himself under their authority. The' Waikatos moved in force to get between Topia and Te Kooti, and there fore Waikota got to their position 1 Te Kooti bolted to Patetere, Hakaria's country, passing j about 28 miles south of Cambridge. Te Kooti j sent word to the King that as hie (Te Kooti) could not take his evil to the king's place, he would take it id another direction. Patetere lies between the Waikato, the Thames, and Tauranga. Mr M'Lean is taking measures in Auckland to attack Te Kooti ; while Mr Ormond is doing the same thing by directing M'Donnell to follow him up from the Taupo side. Attempts were made to get up Caledonian Games by two rival committees in Wellington during the recent festiye season. The rain stepped in as arbitrator between the dis putants, and,- by descending in torrents, de cided that neither party should carry out, their little games.",0,-2.720588576,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/bruce-herald/1870/01/19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,75,THE FINANCIAL DEBATE.,"Wellington, August 8. On the House resuming at 7.30 p.m., The Hon. J. G. WARD moved—"" That the House go into Committee of Supply.?' He said be proposed to explain as far as he could in the time at his disposal the various matters re ferred to in the Financial Statement. It was some seven years ago since the customs tariff was altered, and he thought both sides of the House should assist the Government in devising a proper taiiff which might last some years longer. The Government would be prepared to accept reasonable amendments in Committee. In the first place he desired to state most emphatically that, whilst the Government were prepared to accept reasonable amendment*, if those amendments tended to weaken the Government nuance in any way they would not accept them nnder any consideration. With respect to specul&tive clearances which were made before the Statement was brought down, he regretted that confidential matter was allowed to geb out before the Budget was brought down, which he considered was a very serious matter. It was also exceedingly unfair to people who did not possets such in formation that other peopls were allowed to make clearances the day before the tariff was brought down to the extent of £14,580. The clearances made were mo3tly of articles on which an increase of duty was proposed. He referred to the reduction of the duty on tea, fencing wire, and rice, which amounted to £26,800. It had been said that those reduc tions weio not called for, but the Government would be prepared to accept amendments re specting thebc items. He referred to several other articles on which an alteration in duty had beeu made, and he defended the position he had taken up. Representations had been made to the Government in many directions, one of which was that they should alter ihe date of the coming into operation of the taiiff, so thfct goods ju&t arriving in the colony should come in under the old tariff. This was a difficult position but no change could be m«de, and from tho date of the coming into operation of the tariff all goods coining into Wellington, Lyttelton, or Auckland must come in'uuder the new tariff. He said this in order that importers in various parts of the colony might not remain in doubt. — (Captain Rtjs sell: ""What about cement for the Napier brtakwater."") It was not proposed to make special concessions to any place. The tiriff treaty with Canada was subject to the ratifica tion of Parikment, and if in the ouliuary course of things the House deemed it desirable to eliminate from the proposed treaty any item not thought requioite, that item could be struck out. He mentioned that one of the largest timber merchants in Wellington had told him yesterday that New Zealand could hold its own with C&nadi as far as timber was concerned, but in Committee he was prepared to r*mit tha item of timber to the judgment of the House, and if the timber item were J struck out it would not affect our treaty wiih Canada. They should approach the proposal j for a reciprocal tariff with Canada in a broad spirit. Already some firms in the colony were holding back items which the Government pro posed to put on the free list for Canada. Amongst them were wool and tallow, which wa* a very important mattir for the House to consider. If they ouly got half the woollen industry of Canada they would secure about half a million of money for this colony. He said that the House should realise what outside marktts for our products mean*"", and it should be prepared to give and take in such important matters This was f-.r the benefit of the whole country, and he hoped the House would do its btst to promote the tariff treaty with Canada for exportation of our chief products, and not treat Canada unfairly. Then again, Canada, had offered to take our mails free of charge overland for two years, wbich was in marked contrast to the acbiou of the Uuibed Sfcatr-s, and meant a concession of £5000 a year. That alone showd that that country desired to co-operated with tbU colony. With respect to the fruit proposals of the Government under arrangement with South Australia, he pointed out that if the Home did not accept those proposals they could be varied, but their rejection altogether would not destroy our treaty with South Australia. Sir R Stoat had said in a certain interview that the sinking funds had been seized by the Government. He (Mr Ward) denied that the sinking funds had j beenteized in any way. — (Sir R. Stout : ""You have seized over £20,000 illegally, improperly, and without warrant "") He was not going to difcusi that statement with the member fur Wellington. The sinking funds, he repeated, had not been se-izi d. The Conoliuated Stock Act of 1884- had given authority for the whole transactions respecting tbe sinking funds. If that law were wrong it should have fce?n repealed. — (Sir R. Stout: "" I said it bad been 6eized under the Government Loans to Local Bodies Act."") He (Mr Ward) contended that if any Treasurer acted in acovrd auce with the law he should not be accused of seizing the unking funds. Sir R. Stout was ia the habib of plnying upon the unthiuking. — (Mr T. Mackenzie : "" What are you doing ?"") He (Mr Ward) never did any thing of that kind, and he merely actsd in accordance with the law. One was arc*. zed at the political audacity of Sir R Stout in stating trn.tthe Government seized the sinking fuudj. It was not till the Auditor-general approved of the dispcsal of the accretion of the siukiug fund* that it could be seized as Sir R. Stout asserted, and was it likely the Auditor-general would for a moment consent to such a course as that P He quoted from a ppeech mad« by Sir R. Stout in 1886, in which he bad acted in exactly the same way as the preseut Government did with respect to the sinking funds, and yet he held the Government up to opprobrium for doing what he hi me elf advocated in 1886 There had been no seizure of the sinking fond belonging to local bodies' loans. When those loariß fell due it would be time to discues this matter, and he gave a most emphatic contradiction to Sir R. Stout's state ment that the sinking funds had been seized ; and even if this had been done the law made by Sic R. Stout himself was responsible for it. — (Sir R. Stout : •• It is not the law at all."") It was a point easily cleared np, and if he were wrong he would admit it. He referred at some length to the change made last year in the system of our interest account, and said £103,085 had been saved by the new system of payit.g interest in 189V95, as compared with 1893-94-. If the old system had been continued there would have been £125 769 more payable for our interest than was at present the case. He said the actual result of the new system as against the old system was shown in the Financial Statement, but he admitted it was most difficult to understand. He asked tha House to recollect that it was his desire in considering the proposals of the Government to give the fullest possible informa tion to hon members, and he had endeavoured to do so in order that the position of the colony might be fully understood. He asked the House to consider those proposals impartially, and to give effect to something which would tend to the good of the colony. Sir It. STOUT, in personal explanation, quoted the words he had ufed respecting the sinking fund, and said he had referred solely to local bodies loans. Captain RUSSELL asked whether the debate was to be proceeded with that night, as the Treaturer had jusb made a fresh Financial Statement, and had re-cast all his proposals The Hon. Mr WARD said he had only exercised his right in making the speech he had just made, and he taw no reason for an adjourn ment of the debate. Captain RUSSELL : Which tariff are we to discuss ? We surely ought to know that. The Hon. Mr SEDDON said it was quite evident Mr Ward's speech bad knocked the bottom out of all the figures of the Opposition. The Hon. E. MITCHELSON said Mr Ward bad again this session adopted a new precedent in making two speeches which would not be followed in future. The Treasurer had just com pletely altered his tariff proposals, and had delivered a fresh Financial Statement altogether. The Opposition were prepared to discuse tbe Budget delivered by Mr Ward last week, but it was nob fair to ask them to debate a fresh St*tement altogether. As for the Budget itself it was of the tamest character, and if it was to do any geod for tbe country he could not see where the good was to emue. The only redeeming point in the Budget was the absence of the wild-cat schemes that appeared ia the Budget of last year. Referring to the surplus for the year of £180,000, he said it was £10,000 less than last year, and yet the Treasurer told them the colony was in a prosperous condition. He (Mr Mitcbelson) thought we had reached the bed rock both of the consolidated fuud and public works fund. Mr Ward had told them he had reduced the amount of Treasury bills by £500,000, but he thought tha»s operation muat have tnkeu place very close to the end of the financial year. At the end of the June qu*rter hs had £980 000 Treasury bills outotanding, which was £500,000 more than were outstand ing last year. He thought Mr Ward should not have taken much credit to himself for saving a large amount of money in interest, especially when that saving was made at the expense of those who were compelled to pay the land tax fout. months befoie it was due. There were"" no proposals in tho Budget of the intentions of the Government for carrying out public works in future. He stated that no less than £1,270,000 of loan money had been under the control of the Government since 1891, and ' ot this amount there now remained only £295,000, against which there were liabilities to the extent of £243,000, wbich left only £52,000 £6r new votes for publio works. He referred to' the Codsols Act of last year, which the Government had taken so much credit for, and said the miserable earn invested in th';se consols showed that the people preferred to keep their money in their old stockings rather than invest it in Government consols. Tbe Treasurer had stated repeatedly that the increase to the public debt for the last three years was only £1 500,000, which was a most misleading statement. If members looked at the tables for themselves they would find that on the 31st March 1891 the net debt of the colony was £37.343,923 ; whereas on the 31sfc March 1895 the d<*bt was £39,635,322, showing that the iu,cr«ase for three years was £2,291,109, instead of 61,500,000 as erroneously stated by the Treasurer, who had understated the increase in the public debt by no le3B than £734,495. They were told large savings wei\j made in the interest account, but there was no actual saving owing to the large increase to our public debt for the last three years. He quoted from book-i to prove tbafc we had actually paid for interest last year £68,000 more than in 1891, and asserted it was the large amount; of money the Government took from the sinking fond which had caused the increase in our public debt. He asserted that the Government borrowed very largely since the 31st March 1891, amounting in all to £1 126,892. But if they included bhe amount* borrowed under the Loans to Looal Bodies Act. Cheviot Purchase Act, and the Advances to Settlers Act it brought the amount borrowed by the Government up to £3,330,892, which was not bad for a professedly non borrowing Government. He really thought tie Government should now drop that title, as they had no right whatever to it. The Treasurer had told thorn that pessi mists were always crj ing down the credit of the colony, but notwithstanding that he was not going to say the colony was in a prosperous condition, as the Treasurer stated. If it were so they would not ccc such a number of unem ployed all over the country, which was to be re gretted on every ground. He saw no reason why they should bh.d themselves in treaties with the other colonies as against the mother country. So far as the South Australian tieaty was con cerned, he would not support either th'it or the Canadian treaty ; but he did not know how far the Government were prepared to go in'modify ing both those treaties. If the treaty with S >uth Australia were given effect to it would strike a serious blow at the ""wine industry, especially north of Auckland ; and he was sure no single individual from Auckland to the North Cape wuuld be favourable to the .South Australian treaty. As regards the Canadian treaty, trade with Canada might be againtst New Zealand, and the only two items this colony could send to that country would be wool and woollen goods. Mr Ward had told them Canadian timber would not injure New Zealand^ but he was of exactly the oppo site opinion, and said not only Canadian timber, bub Canadian salmon, if admitted into this couutry, would iDJure the colony's trade. He opposed the Canadian mail service, and raid the House should not entertain it. Referring to the surplus claimed by the Treasurer, he said it was a manufactured"" one and not genuine. After a perusal of the Statement he felt con vinced that the finances of the colony were not in a satisfactory state. As to the tariff pro posals, they were now so modified that the House could not discuss them ; but as for the reductions in tea and kerosene, they were of such a character that the general public would not benefit by them at all. His opinion was that the ' Budget as a whole was an admission that the finances of the colony were not in nearly such a satisfactory condition as the Treasurer stated. It was not a pleasant pros pect for those who would be returned to the next Parliament. He saw no hope at all for the future in the present Budget. Mr PIRANI congratulated Mr Mitchelson on the mildness of his criticism, but said it was different from his speech on 6he Budget last year, when he said the Government supporters bad besn nobbled by large votes on the Estimates. That could not be said on the present occasion, at anyrate. He referred in detail to several other statements made by Mr Mitchelcon last year, and said he had proved to be a prophet of the worst description. -He defended the Government from several charges made against them by Mr Mitchelson, and said the member for Eden had failed to give the Government credit for anything they had done. It seemed to him that all this cry about increasing our public debt and seizing the sinking fund was so much w*si<4 time, as the Opposition would do exactly the same thing, and the Government were only acting in accordance with the law. The fault ot the Fiuancial Statement was that it was not full oi wild-cat schemes, but contained reason '""able proposals for tha good of the colony ; and he hoped the efforts of the Government to ex' end the markets for products would receive the approval of the House. He warmly praised the Budget of the Treasurer, but regretted the Local Government Bill was nob yet before the House, as this was one of the orying necessities of the day. He thought Mr Ward should be congratulated on his intention to modify the tariff, as the tariff certainly required modifica tion, and he trusted the result of the Trea surer's Budget would be to silence croakers ia the colony. Mr DUTHIE thought Mr Ward had taken advantage of the House in addressing them that evening at such length and then having tho right of reply. With respect to the Budget, Mr Ward bad complained that he had been subjected to adverse criticism, but the Government had not put any papers on the table or afforded any infor mation at all to the House. The Statement was a moit involved one and full of inaccu racies. It was not of the cheerful 'character which the House might expeot, but was dolefnl, and there was a whiue right through it. There wai no doubt of the depression that now existed, and the reason for that was that all enterprise was dead, and there was no employment for capital, which was kept looked up iv banks. The decline in the customs returns and railway returns was another sign of the want of confidence in the couutry, and it was for the Government to ascertain the cause of such depression. He did not think the Treasurer was entitled to any congratulations for hij Eitimat^s. They were told by the Treasurer that the sinking fund was used according to law, but he wished to call atten tion to the false representation that was made respecting our position. The real surplus between revenue and expenditure this year was only £15,284, but if the two items for mail ser vice and land settlement had been spent thrro would have been a deficit instead of a surplus of £15,284-. They had a more cheerful Budget last year, which included annexation of Samoa, and this would at any rate have brought a sur plus of 69 cents. He referred to ""the way in which the Treasurer made up his surplus, which* he said was altogether opposed to the way in which a surplus was credited in pri vate life, which was sim ly a balance of receipts over expenditure, and not made up of loan money. He considered there was no justi fication whatever for the Treasurer misleading the Home country as to our real position, and said when the Opposition pointed out thrse misrepresentations they were jeered at by the Treasurer for exercising their undoubted right in exposing his misleading statement. If the Treasurer could disprove bio figures he should be h»ppy to hear his explanation. He asserted that during the four years Ministers bad been in office they had not contributed a shilling from revenue to public works, and tho large increase in our public debt (£2.291,109) showed that the Government had borrowed to a very large extent. He referred at length to the conversion operations . and said that they in ruality meant a loss to the country. He condemned the proposal to appoint a com mifctee to consider the position of the Estates Company, and said the House was not justified in interfering in the matter any furthwr than it h^d already done. After referring to the tariff and proposed treaties with Canada and South Australia, he said the Financial Statement in its dolorous tone was a fair index of the de pression existing in the colony, which was due undoubtedly to the policy of the present Government. Mr HOGG said Mr Duthie had given them a very doleful ppseoh, but he had no doubt done his duty as a member of the Oppoxition in con demning the Statement in every particular. He denied Mr Duthie's assertion that the c 'tony was not progressing and that settlement was not spreading. He considered our exports were never bettt r than at present. Large paUtial buildingfc.were being erected in Wellington, and there was a revival of our mining industry. He warmly approved of the Budget proposals. The public expenditure' at the present tim<a was too heavy and should be reduced. The salaries of civil servants should not be increased whilst the wages ot co-operating men were cut down. He thought the alterations proposed in the tariff were on the whole disappointing. Mr M'GOWAN thought it was a meritorious thing to be lojal to party, but he thought it more meritorious to be loj»l to the country and^ to one's constituents. He considered tho Government were entitled to the highest praise for the splendid financial position the colony had reached. The Government should not forget the people who had placed them in th«ir ponitioi.s, and he failed to Fee what principle guided the Treasurer in framing bis tariff. He could not help asking how the people were to be benefited by the tariff pro posals The reduction of Id per Ib on tea was only giving packers Id for packing their own tea. He referred to the repott of the Tariff Commission, and said the reductions pro posed in three items largely used by the work ing classes — namely, tea, kerosene, and cotton goods— reached no less than £67,806, which contrasted largely with the nature of the reduc tions proposed by the Treasurer. They were told in the Statement that the mining industry was to be benefited, but he failed to see in what way it was to be done. He praiaed reciprocal treaties, but thought they should not too hastily enter into a treaty with Canada. Mr B. M. SMITH moved the adjournment of the debate.— Agreed to.

Continental Europe, America, and.the Australian colo nic., has been ova v_dt of inspection, bj invitation of R. Graham, Esq., to the Wai wera hot springs, and is so plessed with the locality and the numerous advantages of its medicated waters as to consider the place in relation to onr climate superior to any other he has met with in his travels about the world, and ono above all others most fitted for the e.tablii-hi-ent of an hydropathic sanatorium and resort for invalids. From an advertisement in our columns it will be seen that Mr. Turner has commenced the praccict if hvdrop-i hy at the Turkish b*ths, believ ing, from long experience, thar. he can accom tiiish more good by this means than by any ""ther. The theory of his practice is puie air, diet, exeicise, dry heated air, governance oi passions, hot and cold and medicated waters, and judging from his numerous flattering testimonials from persons in all ranks of society and sufferers from all manner of diseases and accidents, some of them only recently presented to him by well known residents in and about this city, be is most successful in bis applications, which appeal to be founded upon common sense principles and natural laws. It is the intention of Mr. Turner to shortly form classes with the view of imparting a practical course of hydro pathic instruction, and giving lessons in ortho^cedic surgery. The City Council yes.erday agreed to the proposed improvements in Custom-house, Commerce, Fort-sreets, and the Breakwater lioad, which will be at once dedicated by the Harbour Board.

The Inspector reported that, c;n-ider iDg tho very rough weather during the past three months, the roads wc-re all fairly good, excepting at Henley,- whsre, akhougn well formed find attended to daring the dry season, it had became very bad, this biicg in a great measure due to the action of the Bettlera in overtaxing the strength of the reads by over loading. Ho thought if thera wai some restric tion in loading from March to August that the roads would be good for light tram?. The bridges wrre all sound at prebtnib. The pUnk iug had not jet bacn puo on the Wtsb Taieri bridge, but the approach had been repaired, and was now in good ordt-r. The inspector drew attention to a portion of the Main South road between Hopthill and Otaki», about six chains of which' was completely honeycombed under the metal with rabbit and water runners; A large hole caved in during tho past montb, and there were several befora that, but fortu nately they were seen ta before anything happened. A portion of the road near Mr Gray's farm would have to be formed. Regard ing Mr ML'Lay's application for improve ments on Mold street, Arden towrsbip, Slrath-Taieri, he recommended that a small footpath ftom the doctor's hou3e to the school would fully answer the purpose. Regarding Mr Glei.diuiug's application for a road from Bdrewood station to tho railway siding, he found that a ncrvice&ble road could be made for Mr G'eudining's estimate, and he had called for tendera for the worlr. Tho walls of the bridge had been built by men emp'oyed by Mr G'eudiuiag, and the superstructure, which the inspector would carry out hi ai self, would cost £12. In company with the Bruce County's inspector he visited the site of the Taieri mouth ferry on the 25th July, and chained the approaches to the puot on both sides.

The workings were about 100 links below the level of the roadway, and the drives hid been taken out abaufc Bft wide to a vatyiug height ef an average of 6ft.

Where ground was undernxii'ed, it was almost impossible to Siy when d u.ger of the • road collapsing might be 10. k^d for, as so maoh de pended on the intervening strat vaud tbe extent to which the future workings of the mine might be carried. The only way to provide for the absolute safety of the road would be to pack the drives with well-rammed dry clay or rotten rock, and entirely shut eff thsao working* from any others, as, in cue of a fire taking place ih the mine and the corn<q««ufc removal of the pillars, a sub>idenc3 of the road would ba the inevitable result. There were other workings, but they were filled up with water, and could not be surveyed. lie hardly thought, however, that there would bs any of them under the road. It wag agreed thai the owner of the mine be advised of the engineer's repcr!-, and that he be aslcel to remedy the matter as recommended, and that, failing compliance, he be proceeded against.

Temoka Weslbxan Cbuboh.—The annual harvest thanksgiving seryioes in connection with the Wesleyan Ohurch, Temuka, ware held in the Volunteer Hall, Temuka, on Sunday, the new church not yet being eora pleted. The hall was most tastefully decoratad for the occasion by Mesdamos bunn and Barrett. Quite a profusion of seasonable fruits, flowere, and evergreens were arranged in choice groups about the building, and the stage displayed sheaves of corn, clusters of vegetable?, etc., in all the beauty of autumnal tints. The large congregation that assembled were unanimous in the opinion that such tasteful decorations had never before been witnessed. In the morning the Eev. R. S« Bunn delivered a very impressive discourse the subject being "" An Agricultural Truth.'' The address was listened to most attentively' In tho evening to a still larger congregation, be preached upon "" The Mystery of Growth,"" handling his subject with skill and eloquence. Appropriate hymns were sung for the occasion. In the morning Mr Harrison pre sided at the harmonium, and in the evening Mr J. Holwoli. In addition to the choir Hie newly organizsd band of six performers rendered efficient services, their accompani ments to the hymns being much appreciated, A G-ibl Want.bd.—Early in February last a girl namad Ada Robinson, about 13 years of age, oommitted a petty larceny from bee em ployer ia Timaru, and suddenly left the house. She took the ro/.d for Waimute, ind tramped as far as Simmons', at Makifeihi, giving out that her name was Smith. Sim had not been losg there, however, when it was discovered that she had givon a fube name, and was also found out in othsr un truths. She was told to leave the place, and she went to M'floverin and Hardie's. Here a lad named Lane happened to know her, and said she was a Wairu;>t<? girl, and that, her mother livod at I\unstown. Lane was ordered to get a buggy and drive her to town. When they got us far as NoaJces's she asked to be let down, as she wanted to walk tlu> remainder of the distance. This occurred two months ago, and she has not benu seen since, though the police and detectives have been looking for her ever since. Her mother eays she has never seen her, nor has any of her brother or sisters, of whom she has several. It is no'o intended to pioa?cuto ihe girl far the larceny, but the police are desirous of learning of har whereabouts, and anyouo knowing should communicate with them at once.—Waimute Times.

Mr Gunn staffs that they went to bed shortly after 1 a.m. on Sunday. They bad some words, but were both quite sober. Mrs Gunn lay on the floor with a pillow under her head. At 9.30 a.m. he went downstairs to get a cup of tea, but be returned twenty minutes afterwards and spoke to her, but got no answer, and noticing something peculiar about her appearance he examined her and found that she was dead. He found that a box which had contained opium pills was quite empty. He made the pi'ls for his own use. He raised an alarm and Dr J. H.

They had been married ten years, and she was thirty years of age.—Press. The Other Side.— A Waimato resident has received a letter from Sydney giving an idea of the keen competition for em ployment there and in Melbourne, The following is an extract“ The Victorian Government are opening up a number of new lines, and advertised for ten architec tural, eleven engineering, and two mechanical draughtsmen ; also engine drivers, stokers, cleaners, platelayers, guards, &c.—in all 628 vacancies. The first three are the best paid, the minimum being 12s 6d a day, the other positions for laborers not being so well paid, re ceiving from 7s 6d to 10s a day.

222,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,149,NOTES BY TERROR.,"• . • The Dunedin Fanciers' Club's third an null poultry, /pigeon, canary, and dog show was held la»t week on Friday and Saturday, 2nd and 3rd imt. This is the eleventh year that the Dunedin Society has held a show, and the third since the amalgamation with the D >g Club of Otago. Without doubt the dog show was about the poorest show I have ever seen beld here. In a few classes the exhibits were very fine, but in others very poor, and it is astonishing in these days of advanced know ledge in this direction to flad fanciers showing their ignorance to the extent they do in ven turing to exhibit srch curiosities to (be public gaze as tome of those shown last week. I should s>rongly advise such fanciers to try to become acquainted with their fancy at once. I also sincerely trust thtt the committee will be able to find a better place for their next show, for none more unsuitable for the purpose than the cellar at the Garrison Hail could, I fancy, be discovered in Dubedin. With these few preliminary remarks I shall proceed to business • . "" Mas* iff dog or bitch : This class brought out three dogs, of which Mr Carroll's Jumbo wss the best. He is a very fair animal. Mr M'ladoe's Lion is only fair. St. Bernard : This class to my mind had only one fairly good animal. Mr Rossiter's Prince Carlo is, I believe, the best St. Bernard we have in the colony. Others were very poor. This cls.sk requires a lob of fresh blood. Newfoundlands were represented by one very moderate animal. Deerboueds : There was only one entry for this class. We missed Mr Haynes's exhibits. Greyhounds were, I think-, b*dly judged. Mr Myers's Rvzzle D«zz!e ought to have been first, jyith Port Phillip second and Sydenharn third. Lizze Woods was first in the bitch cl<iS3, with very little to spare from Alpine Rose. Two very nice youngaters were exhibited in the puppy clam — Oarbina first, Miss Razzle second • . • In the Eoglii-h setter mixed class Mr Mathewn's slut Ripping Stream won easily. She is really a very nice light-coloured bitch, showing excellent points, but on the small side. She has a good head, body, legs, and feet. When a really good dog is shown in a clasa the poor quality fare badly in comparison. The English setter puppy das were all very poor. The Gordon setter Jack, belonging to Dr Jeff ooat, is a very fair dog, Mr Leonard Blank's champion Hermwood Rake was missed this year in this class. Irish tetters were represeuted by one poor exhibit — Me C. Anderson's Heatber — and from the appearance of this animal I am inclined to doubt his relationship with the Heather family. In tue class for curly-coated retrievers there were right entries. Mr Morton's Totara was fair for the clasi to which he belongs — that is to say, the colonial retrievers. It would be idle to compare him with the bitch clas3, how ever, where O. B Nell, an imported dog, wag exhibited for the first time in Dunedin. She simply absorbed all the attention in her class till one would think she was the only retriever there, and she looked vary pretty with her litter of pups by her side. In the puppy clans there were ouly three entries — two pups by Rowi and C. B. Nell, seven months old, and a brown bitch. ftTr Rankin's Rewi Truth was first, with Rewi Moa (bitch) second. Had Truth been entered in the open class he would have won. The next was Messrs Aitkeu and Son's pointer dog Spot, the ouly one entered, and a fair specimen oaly. • . • Only one entered in the clumbers, and this I could not find. In fact, though he got first prize, I doubt whether he was At the show. In cockers there were several. At the last year's show Miss Grant's Stanley got flrtt and special as best cocker in tbe show. This year he is entirely passed over, being in tbe judge's opinion, aud rightly so, not a cocker at all. Afc Christchurch Springhill Signal, a puppy of 10 months, got first and special in the open class dogs and bitches, beating Tiny, a Cbristchurch bitch under Mr Watson. Though Signal has improvi d very much with age, at last week's ■how he was put down by the slut Tiny. This reversal of judgment is rather remark able. • . • Irish water spaniels were very poor. The collie class for dog < and bitches that had won more than two first-class prizes was won very easily by Mr Bigg's Opawa Doo. H,e was not looking at his best by any means, but was a long way ahead of the other two exhibits. The best in tbe smooth-coated collies was Mr M'Laren's Fan. She is a very nice bitch, shoe ing a good bit of quality. In the, puppy c'ass Mr Wedge's Lass, seven months, won ; she was certainly the best of that class. • . • The class for rough-coated dogs brought out 11 representatives, and, as in some other cases, there was very poor judging here ; for I think Mr F. Rogen's First Shot ought to have been pkced fi sl-,s 1 -, with Mr JowiU's Rautioc hsec nd »nd MrN.jill's Don third. Mr Williams's New mirkat Maxim faced the judge for the first time. He is a puppy of very light colour, but to my mind his bead and ears should have carried him almost through. Bat for hi* very bad condition, and being entirely out of coat, he could not have helped putting Firafc Shot down. First Shot, no doubt, ig a very good dog — one that Mr Rogen can be proud of. Mr Jowitt's Rannoch was lookiug at his best, but I don't think he is really, correctly speaking, of the came class as Mr Williams's and Mr Rogen'a dogs. Mr Neill's Don is a, very handsome little dog, on the small side, but with an im mense coat, and when excited seems to show himself off to the best advantage. The others were very much below those named. • . • In collies, in the reugh-coated bitch class Mr Jowitt's Rimu Bright Eyes was no doubt pUced correctly, being firs 5, but Opawa Zeatu was very close vp — in fact, I think them almost on a par. Mr Parker's Minnehaha was placed second to Bright Byes, but this, to my mmd — and in the opinion of many others — wan badly judged. With such a head and ears as Minne haha no other point ought to have been sufficient to put her down. Mr Stanton's Rimu Snowdrop, full litter Bister to Mr Jowitt's Bright Eyes, was not in the luuning at all ; aud the same may be said of the others. * . ' Rough-coated dog or bitch under 12 months old brought forth nine. Of these Mr R. B. Williams's Newmarket Maxim was with drawn from further competition. He was ordered to stand down on account of his colour. I never understood before that colour should disqualify a collie. With collies oolour is quite immaterial. I am not at all surprised to find that Mr Williams was disgusted at being ordered out of the ring on that account. * . * Rough-coated dog or bitch under 12 months : Only one need be mentioned in this class, as practically there was only one in it — Mr Rogeu's First Faith. She is one of the finest young bitches I aver had the pleasure of seeing. She quite outdid the others, none of them coming within coo-ec of her. Mr Jowitt's Ren frew L*ddie (eight mouths) is a very nice dog, but I don't think th*t he, or the dog placed third, will ever be any nearer to first place than they were at the time of judging. First Faith i 9 a young bitch of magniilront quality, bsing ""quality"" from the tip of the nose to tho end of the tail. ' * . ' The rou^h-coated novice class for dogs and bitches that had not won a first prize brought out again a Dig number of dogs. Thirteen faced thn judge, but in this class, as in the previous one, Mr Rogen's First F*ith simply waltzed in. A most remarkable blunder was raa.de in this class. First Faith's ticket was marked 105, but in taking the number from the tin label 102 was put down iv ihe judge's book, thus representing Mr P. Parker's Bonnie Jean to have taken first and special, not withstanding tha fact that Jean had not left Napier and had never put in an appear ance This seems to me ta ba gross careless ness on the part of the person taking the num ber off. The second do^ was Mr Neill's Don, and Opawa Diamond third. For my p\rt I expected Diamond to be put before Renfrew Laddie. I cannot understand how a judge can place a dog with absolutely pricked ears. "" . * The claas for collie dog or bitch owned in Otago and Southland brought forth several of the previous wiuners. Mr Jowitt's R^nnoch w*S placed firat, Mr Nill's Djn second, and Mr Aitcheson's Dounil Dhu third. Bright Eyes was with drawn from this class. • . * The pup class owned in O'-Ago and S »uth land saw Mr Jowitt's Renfrew Danger placed first, and the same owner's Rsmfrow Laddie second and Renfrew Lady Bounce third, which possibly was a correct decision. * . ' Tbe bearded collie dag or bitch class brought out two or three very good animals, but I think that Mr Mafchew Wright's Great Scott ought to have been either fir»t or secor.d, and why the judges only phced firib and eecoQ'l in this class and no third I cannot understand. * . * The fox terriers' show was very po r, bay ing only some 10 or 11 repre e-itatives in place of, as ia former years, 40 or 50, or more, and in this c'asa there wss nothing d' serving Fp°cKl notice. Mr Young's Nuidp-.'h rvxke-., a very nice little di.g <viMi very fair fur? j-act l>u<. bin<i quarteis very bad, w*s placed first. Mr Orboll's Rtsdfttrn Turcoman, eecond, is not of the first class, aud the others were of very fair order. No doubt Mr Young's dog Neidpath Rocket was correctly placed in the bitch class. Tho sanie owner's Neidpath Divert is a very fair bitch. This was tho poorest class of fox terriers ever sho>vn hire. • . • Skyu terriers : One really good dog was shown — viz , Mr J. C. Shore's Bauchle*. I question whether there is a better dog iv the colony. •. • In the Scotch terriers Mr C&ntwell's Dominie Sampson was correctly placed first, with the same owuer's Peat second. • . • Iv the Irish terriers three only weut, aud the same with the Irish tcrri-r bitoh*s — neither very high clasiea. In the Innh terrier dog or bitch under 12 months Mi is R 'sa Bl*ney's Peggie was first and Mr Neill's Tara Stcoad. Ni-icher of them is likely to make a first class animal. • . ' In the blaok-and-tan there was one very fair animal— viz., Mr Miller's bitch (seven monthi) ( • . ' Bull terriers : Mr Hopcraft's Turk w»s looking very well, and he, I thiuk, eat-ily put down Mr Watson's Dalkeith Chief. Turk is a good dog all round. • . * In bulldogs only two were shown, and they were or a very poor order. '. • In the epor'iug team class Mr Young took off with Neirtpith Rocked, Nr>irlpafh p.vt*rb, and Neidpath Dorcas Mr Jowift touk in the non-sporting teams. ' . * In sporting pnirs Mr Myers'a Lizzie Wood and K<zzte D.izz'ewere placed before Mr Young's Neid path Rocket and Nfridpath Divert, which no doubt was the correct thing to do. • . * The following registrations of pedigrees have beea made during the week :— Gyp, Irish terrier slut-; Terry and Worry, Irish terrier pups. The pups are for sale.",0,-2.833837651,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The committee appointed to inspect tho Ridge road reported that tho work was- not urgent; and recommendid that nothing Bhould be done at present. The rate of -Jd in the pound was con firmed, and made payable on the sth inst., and if; was impressed on the collector that there must ba no delay in jetting the rate in, as four months of the period for which the rate is due have already passed. Mr Kerr appeared to lay before the board the special hardship inflicted on him by the reso lution to put a stop to all sledging on the puhlfc roads. He urged that the entrance to his property was so steep that he would be unable to work his dairy farm without sledging the produce on the road. The board gave the matter lengthy con ■ideration, and, while fully recognisiug tho great difficulties Mr Kcrr had to contend with, resolved that it was- impossible to discriminate, as com plaints had been received, not only of darn n go done to the roads, but al«o of the rUkof accidents through such a niii.sanco being permitted. There was a .possibility of involving the district iv claims for damages, and it was determined to take action against offenders. A circular was received from the ilutt County Council asking the board to appoint a delegate to the conference. No action waa taken, the opinion beiDg that any steps in tha direction of Amalgamation would not be to the odvaiitago of the district. The local c nstaVlo w*» complimented on the greater freedom of the dist'ict io&ds from the nuisance of stray cattle. Accounts for £113 19s 3d were passed for pay ment.

The Blackstona Hill Club in consequence are the fortunate winners of this moßt 'handsome trophy — the case of carvers. Bravo ! Blackstone Hill. I might mention hera that the ice, owing to the snowfall on Saturday evening and the thaw on the following day, was not by any means of good quality, and the play was not excellent on either side.

There was a crowded meeting of sheep farmeri"", lastiog over four hours, to hear addresses on the meat trade from Messrs D. J. Nathan and W. Nelson. After M* Nftt-han bai explained his scheme, Mr Nsl-jon rep'ied at great length. He contended thab the proposed Bcheme and the guarantee were quite uunecassary. He proposed opening shops in the provinces, maintaining that E-sSi.man'a and Nelson and Sons' 1000 frozen meat shops and other 2000 butchers who sold frozen meat were better vehicles for the distribution of meat. He denied that low prices were due to want of store ga accommodation in London. Aboub four rnonbha' supply could be stored, and there were many stores iv the provinces. H<j quoted detailed figures to show that the meat was well dis tribubed all over the provinc s. He ridiculed the idea of a Smithfield ring, contending that if there was a combination strong enough ta regulate tho price ib would not be confined to 3000 or 5000 tons of frozeu mutton sold every month when 2000 tons of fresh meab was eo'.d at a high price. The relabivtly- betber price of New Zealand lamb was v also quobej as nfgab : ving the idea of a ring.* He bhoroughly agreed with Mr Nathan bbat concenbration and combination in London was the sole solution of the present disorganised stabe of the market, bub stated that this had now been effected under the naw Co-oparative Distribution Com pany jusb formed in London to deal with the whole of the consignments from Australia.

44,1896-11-09,OAM,Oamaru Mail,2,Awamoko Blue Ribbon Army.,"The usual monthly meeting of the Awamoko Blue Ribbon Army was held on Wednesday evening last, in the Awamoko school. There were about 50 people present. Mr Edward Fricker (Vice- President) occupied the chair. The weather during the day had been bitterly cold, and was the means of keeping a good many away. A good programme had been ar ranged. Much praise is due to the re sponsible parties for arranging such' a programme. The first item was the sing ing of the 64th hymn (Sankey), "" Only trust Him,"" by the audience. The Chair man then read the Scripture lesson from Titus, and Mr Allen engaged in prayer. Captain Sansand was then called upon, and rendered ""Sailing away,"" which was much appreciated and suited the occasion. Mr J. King gave a reading, dealing princi pally with the evils of intemperance, also pointing out that every man and woman of this country would soon be called upon to decide whether the grog shops of bur country should exist or not. Miss Smillie sang "" The Saviour's Call,"" which was a spiendid item, and war just what ought to be sung at a Gospel temper ance meeting. Miss Thompson was then called upon and sang, in a sweet, clear voice, ""The Holy City."" It evidently was not the first time that young lady had sung the same in public. Mr Allen sung "" anchor hold,"" which was also a. very good item. A company song was then contributed by five Gospel temper ance workers, which was well rendered, entitled ""Strikeout the top line,"" which every right-thinking person will be .asked to; do at the forthcoming licensiiigTelec tion* Lieutenant Walker then sang ""Jesus is my light,"" with banjo accom paniment, which was a pleasure to listen to, and well suited to the occasion. Miss %tevenwas called upon and rendered, in her usual pleasing manner, ""Throw but the; fife lineV She, was"" accompanied'by tife violin. The next item was the last but not least, one which is quite'common at such helps to defray expenses.

45,1896-11-09,OAM,Oamaru Mail,3,Cricket.,"AUSTRALIANS v. AUCKLAND. (BY TELEGHAPH.) Auckland, November 7. The cricket match Australians v. an Auckland eighteen was resumed to-day ab noon, in the Domain. There was beau tiful weather, and 4000 people were present. Auckland continued their innings, G- Mills and Stemson, the not outs, going to the wickets, the batsmen resuming to the bowling of Jones and M'Kibbin. The score jras carried to 29, when Mills was clean bowled by a short pitched one from M'Kibbin —29 —2—16. Mills played excellently. Cuff filled the vacancy, but after 11 was added ran ouc Stemson—29 —3— 4. J. Mills next partnered Cuff, only to lose his com panion, who, after adding a single, spooned one into Iredale's hands at mid on—3o—4—l. Labatt was the next batsman, and the pair remained together until the partnership had produced 9, at which stage Labatt lifted one into Gregory's hands at cover point. He was followed by Ohlsen, who saw 11 added to the score before he was dismissed, clean bowled by M'Kibbin —50 —6— 5. Pabst was next in, and assisted Mills to carry the figures to 61, when he was retired, Eady accepting one lifted to him at square leg—6l—7—7. On the arrival of Kal lender the scoring went on rapidly, his vigorous batting being mainly responsible for the score realising 81 before he gave Jones an easy catch at mid-off, which was accepted. After lunch play was resumed, J. Mills beine joined by R Neill, Trott re lieving M'Kibbin. Neill started off by sending Trott for 3, and followed this up by pulling a full pitch from Trumble to leg for 4, and then getting Trott away for 3. After a slow spell Mills was caught at point by M'Kibbin, after making the top score of 20 by some careful play—9s—9 20; D. Hay signalised his advent by a drive for % followed by a few singles, bringing up the century. At this stage Darling caught Neill in the slips off Trott but with the score at 102 the newcomer retired with a single—lo2 —11—1. _ The advent of Wynyard made matters lively, the latter making some brilliant drives, and Hay responding with several couples, one over producing no less than 16 runs. However, the partnership was brought to an end by Wynyard giving Eady an easy catch at mid-wicket —119—12—12. Mar shall succeeded Wynyard, scoring 3 by an overthrow. After a 3 by Hay and a cut for 2 by Marshall 130 appeared on the board, but at this point Hay retired, caught behind the wickets by Kelly 130—13—15. Holland filled the vacancy, Jones succeeding Trott in the bowling. A slow spell ensued, relieved by two snicks each for 3 by Marshall. Shortly after, Holland, attempting a doubtful run, lost his wicket—l34—l4 -3. Stone followed, but the second ball from Trumble shattered his wickets without increase in the score. Lawson filled the vacancy, but shortly afterwards was bowled by Jones, who broke his stump in half. Williams succeeded, but was clean bowled by Jones first ball. The innings closed at 4 o'clock for 140. The last three players made ""duck's eggs."" In the Auckland innings five maidens were bowled in succession. The Australians, with an advantage of 22, began their second innings with Dar lingand Iredale to the bowling of Kallender and Neill. Iredale started off by sending Kallender to the boundary, and after a few byes Darling repeated the dose, and 10 appeared. A number of singles, re lieved by two boundary hits, gradually brought the score up to 30, when Stemson took the ball from Kallender. Shortly afterwards Darling made a boundary hit. off Neill. Stemson's bowling made little difference, and 40 soon appeared. Hay replaced Neill at the other end, and Dar ling sent the last ball of the over to the boundary. Next over Hay cleverly caught Iredale at forward cover-point, catching the ball where he stood with his left hand —44 —1—12. Kelly followed, and Dar ling made a boundary hit, bringing the score up to the half century. ""With the score at 53 Darling lifted one from Stem son over the bowler's head, and Ball, running backwards, made the most bril liant catch of the day, falling in the act of catching the ball. Darling made his score of 32 by excellent play, piling up six fours. Hill came in, and with Kelly played out time, two wickets being down for 68. The stumps were drawn at 6 p.m. Play will be resumed at 11 a.m. oh Mon day. Scores: — Auckland—First innings. G.

The contrifugal pump fitted to the dredge .Progress was subjected to an exhaustive trial on Thursday last, in the Dunedin Har-. bor, between Ravensbourne and St. Leo nards. It was found that the pump threw a full volume of water, and when tried in the fine sand it also threw a satisfactory amount. The test was sufficient to show that the pump will lift sand and water perfectly well, but it has yet to be found what work it will do in shingle. After the test some minor alterations were found necessary, in cluding the reducing of the pulley to slow the engines.

145,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,72,"SATURDAY, AUGUST 3.","The report of the Minister for Railways upon the work of the year points out that for three fourths of the financial year ended March last the Railway Commissioners were in office. Improvements in working and management have been effected which h -,ye proved profitable, and furtliT improvements are in contem plation. The working rtsuitj for the year, as com ph fed with the previous year, are as follows : — Toe gro3B receipts have declined by £21 141, and the net receipts by £18,743. The percentage of expenditure to receipts has advanced from 62 - 70 to 63 62 ; while the interest on the capital invesbtd has declined from £2 17^ 9d per cent, in 1893-94 and £3 10a in 1892 93 to £2 14s 6d in 189*. The railways, however, earned about £40,000 for service rendered to the colony but not paid for. Had this amount been credited the earnings would have been £2 19s 9d per cent. These unsatisfactory results were due principally to diminished buaiuesa and the almost entire stoppage of the export of wheat. The export of this staple during the previous year was 2,619,398 bu^hfls, whilst the export last year was .only 228,904 bushels, a loss of considerably over 2,000,000 busheU. The num bar of passengers travelling declined to the ex tent of 7123, and the goods traffic by 5367 tons, and this notwithstanding that 45 additional ""miles of line were opened during the year and the total mileage travelled was greater by 108,389 miles. There was a decrease of £3199 in working expenses. The total capital in vested in the Hues is £15,352,613, an increase for the year of £215,577. Tbe gross revenue for the current year is estimated at £1,155,000, or only a moderate increase on the actual re ceipts of last year. The question of amalga mating the Public Works and Railway depart ments is under consideration. RECIPROCITY AND THE TARIFF. Ministers <n\-» realising that in tampering with tho lat iff aud making reciprocal treaties that dislocate vested interests they have got 'twixt the devil and the deep sea. To ret re it is to be discredited, and to go through with their fiscal programme will be to stimulate discontent r among a considerable section of their following that may quickly grow to disorganisation. Indeed"", it is now a question whether Govern- | ment supporters do not view the tiriff pro posals with more disfavour than merab rs of j | the Opposition. Already it is being whispered that the reciprocity treaties, particularly the j Canadian, will be abandoned. RAILWAY MANAGEMENT. Mr J. L. Scott, late one of the Railway Com* miseionera, has contributed some fuefs re* lating to the maintenance workshops of thaft great department that add greatly to thd interest of the annual report fust laid before Parliament. Mr Scott, on vacating his office as R«ilway Commissioner, wrote to tho Premier on the 31st December last that the primitive style in which the maintenance workshops are equipped and conducted is poutively astound* ing. Only a country blacksmith without work or meant would think of continuing such a state of things. Men were doing not' more than a fourth of the work they could do with better appliances. The blaoksmiths were emulating the village blacksmith in working at hand blown forget with heavy railway metals. No private employer would dream of doing- sucfi work with similar appliances. The fancy of tho department for using up old rails was mistaken and costly, as there was a ready sale for them, and they could be used also for telegraph poles without waste of labour. The work in tha maintenance department cost from 50 to 75 per cent, more than it ought, and a great deal of it ought not to be done at all, or, if done, should be done differently. The maintenance shops should be closed and then transferred to the locomotive department, which had tha necfiftsary appliances. As for the locomotive department, the Addington workshops were well equipped aud splendidly manned. Hilhude wanted ° some very c-sseutial tools. Petono, Newmarket, and _G*«towu vrc-re each capable of di iog all the repairs of tbe districts, and Petone nnd New market were large enough to do a quantity of new worfr. New engines of better design could be made for the cost of converting the p reliant engines,' 12 of which were now being converted, while the unconverted engines would still bo available. The artisans would esmpxre favour ably with those of any engineering establish ment in the world, bat he condemned the management of the department. Cummenting on this letter, Mr Lowe, the chief engineer, says that Mr Scott overstated the case, and while comnrs'Moner never mide any such representa tion to the engineer, and there were serious objections to making the maintenance depart ment dependent entirely on the locomotive workahofs. Mr Rotheram, tho locomotive superintendent, also points out that while Mr Scott was commissioner he had special control of locomotive matters, but though he could have stopped the work of conversion, of which he was informed, he never did so, nor did he raise tha slightest objection. Mr Scott also requested th\t cartnin experimen** to which he now took exception should be continued. THE RAILWAY EXAMINATION. The report of Mr Hales (engineer-in-chief) and Mr C. Napier Bell upon the results of their six months' examination of the Government railway lines, undertaken on the Govtrnmcn* taking them over, states that the railways had generally baen maintained in a very satisfac tory condition. S»f<sty and efficiency were nowhere impaired. Renewals hid been effected which increased the stability and valae of the railways and rolling stack, and white oxfcensiva repairs snd renewals were constantly ia derrund, they had been fairly well provided for with due regard to economy. IMPORTANT RAILWAY PROPOSALS. The Minister for Railways ia his report says that further reductions are contemplated in ta« freights on dairy produce, &o. ; »L«o improve ments in respect of workmen's trains and holi day excursions at Christmas, Easter, and other principal holidays. Cheap extended excursion tickets ftom the centres of popu'ation to the country and vice versa are to be issued at a unifoim rate of Id per mile for the return journey second class, with a minimum fare of 28 ; a proportionately higher rate will be charged first-class. The "" Pint- ch"" system of compressed gas now in operation on the English lines is to be introduced for the lighting of rail way carriages. The first line to be *o lighted is to be the Hurunui-Blnff. The cost will be about -|d per light per hour, as against $d per light per hour under the prrsenb unsatis factory system, white the light will be all that can be desired. One heavy eDgine has just been built at Addingt m, and five others are in hand. Three of these are for the Christcharch- Dunedin express, but they are too heavy for the present 40lb-rail sections still on some parts of the line. They could not at present run further south than Ashburton owing to the necessity of re-laying 531b rails and strengthening the bridges. It will be two years before the engines can run through. LAND 3 AND SURVEY RE POST. The Minister for Lfcnds laid upon the table of the Houie yesterday the annual report of the Linda and Survey department. It states that there were two very prominent features in con nection with the dealings ia Crown Land* last year;. There was a falling off in the unrnbar of selections as compared with- the previous year, tbis being in parb due to the want of accessible lauds, settlement haviog in most districts ex tended beyond the roads. It was also partly caused by the scarcity of really good land. Recent acquisitions of good land by the Crown will enable tho department to offer deniable selections to many people who ire waiting lor land. The most popular of the optional sys tems during the year was the occupation with right tr> purchase system, under which there wers 398 selectors of 75,477 acres, lease in per petuity coming next with 336 selectors of 87,374 acres, while under tho c*sh system there were 174 selectors of 33,323 acres. The quantity o£ land opened for selection during the ytar was I 1,132,933 acres, and the average size of tha | farm allotment! taken up was 161 acres — 31 acres less than last year. THE FROZEN MEAT TRADE. | The Government have decided to appoint an officer in London to watch the interests of the calony in respect of the frozsn mea.fi trade. Such an officer, the Minister for Agriculture says, could report as to the coadifcion of tho meat on arrival at tbe Central London Moat Market, the system of priority of selection by certain butcher*, the difference between the price given for first and second selections of meat, and also the average of percentage of carcases rejected as unfit for food before reaching the hands of the retail trade. EVIDENCE 'FURTHER AMENDMENT. The Statutes Revision Committee has made various amendments in the Evidence Further Amendment Bill and incorporated with it tha Hon. Mr MacGregor's Law of Evidence Amend ment Bill. The new features include a pro vision by which a court ia left to decide whether a witness need answer any question put in cross-examination relative to matter not rele vant to the proceedings, except in so far as it affects his credit by injuring his character. Tbe court may prevent any scandalous or indecent questions, unless they relate to facts in issue, and shall forbid any question intended to insult or annoy or which appears needlessly offensive. Questions which the court would not ptrrtnifc to be put must not be published. Ia poi«oning cases evidence as to administration of poison by accused to other persons or at other times shall be relevant. Confessions are not to Ye rejected in evidence on the ground of any pcoimatf or threat having been held out to |he confessor, unlees the court believes that the inducement was calculated to cause an untrue admission of guilt being made. JOTTINGS. ■ Last year the Lands department employed an avenge of four men on 15b5 co-operative iontractc, at an average wage of 6s 6£d, with a minimum of 2s 2d and a maximum of 12s 6d. Tha works which the Railway department Vas asked to perform in the three months of Government control up to the 31st March ■would have cost £100,000, and the concessions refused would hare meant a loss of revenue of many thousands a year. Mr J. C. Martin, S.M., will be president of the North IsUnd Railway Board of Appeal and District Judge Ward of the Bouth Island Board.

Taieri Stock Fair and Horae Sale.— Donald Reid and Co report : — The entry at our sale yards at Allan ton on Tu-sday was a small one, comprising 220 crosibred hopgets, 45 head cattle, and 11 horses. Although there wa? a laige gathering of farmers and others present, bidding was not particularly brisk, and the sale proceeded very slowly. All the sheep and most of the cattle fouud buyers, however, at fair prices. For horses thore whs very little competition, and only a few changed hands. Crossbred hoggets sold at 6s, two-year-old steers at £3 to £3 2s 6d, yearlings at £2 to £2 7s 6d, beifera at £3 2s 6d to £4 10s, dairy cows at £3 to £4 2s 6d, horses at £3 15s to £7 6s. Country Sale?.— The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company (Limited) held their fortnightly sale at the Crown yards, Bal clutha, on Friday, the 2nd inst., and under the influence of the fine day there was a very full attendance of buyeis bsnt on business, but un fortunately a uutuber had to go away unsatisfied owing to the small entries of st ck presented both in sheep and cattlo, the number of each to hand being small. All offered, however, were well com peted for, and very satisfactory prices obtaining. Crossbred wethers and ewes (mixed) sold at from 8s 7d to 9s 6d, and aged cows at from £5 2s 6d to £5 15s.— The Farmers' Agency Company (Limited) held a clearing sale at Seacliff on Monday last for Mr S S.

Store Sheep.— The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company (Limited) sold during the past week 1000 ciossbred eweß (iv lamb) at the vendor's price. Rabbitskins. — Moderate catalogues were sub mitted on Monday. There wore a few lots of ofF-season skins, but the majority of tho offerings wera winters, several lots of which proved in prime condition. There is an excellent demand for all classes, and the competition, as usual, was very keen. Extreme prices were paid for blacks, 17JJ per lb being realised for a superior line. We think, however, that prices for this class will not be maintained, as we believe that buyers have only small orders, and as soon as these ar« filled prices will again recede. Winter blacks and silver-greys sold at 14d to 17Jd ; best winter greys, lljd to lad ; ordinary, JOd to lid ; medium and off-season, 4d to 8d ; small, IJd to 3d. Sheepskins — Moderato catalogues were sub mitted oa Tuesday, consisting of the usual assort ment of country clients' consignments, as well as greon bkins from the loral butchers. There was a splendid demand, both shippers and fullmoneers operating freely, and prioes realued were ex tremely satisfactory.

Prime rendered, 17« to 18»6d per cwt ; medium, 14s ftd to 16« ; inferior, 12s 6d to 13s 6d ; rough fat, 9a to 12s. Grain.— Wheat : The poi-itUm is very similar to that of last week. Very little business has trans pired, the quantity changing hwidji b*ing umim portant; indeed there is not much to • ffer. The bulk of the wheat now consumed locally ownes from the north, which has been purchased earlier in the season ; at the same time any small lots offering are readily placed at prices on a par with those lately quoted, which are : lor prime milling Tuscan and v»lvet, 3e 9id jo^ 3* lid ; good t-i beet, 3b 8d to 3s 9d ; medium, 3s 7d to 3s 8d ; iaforior, 3s 3d to 3s 6d (ex store, sacks weighed in, torms). Oats: Transactions during tho past week have been unimportant, but holders for the most part aro firm, considering the present lull only t«m porary, as immediately tho supplies sent away from here and the Bluff some time since are run down it is expected that the drop at tfce moment will Boon be lecovered. Meantime buyers de cline to operate at over the following quotations say : For prime milling (bright and stout), Is 8d to Is BJd ; best bright ktout short feed, Is 7id to Is 8d ; medium to good, Is 6Jd to Is 7d ; inferior to medium, 1* 5d to Is 6il ; prime long Tartar* (full and bright) for se^d, Is 9d to 2s (fcx store, sacks extra, net).

Quotations : For Prime maltiag, 2s 10J to 3s ; medium to good. 2s 6d to 2» 8d ; feed and milling, Is Od to 2s 3d (ex store, sacks extra, net). Potatoe*.— The demand at present is extremely poor, and sales, even at reduced values, are diffi cult to effect. There is some inquiry for prime northern Derwents, hut the low rates now ruling cannot be expected to tempt growers to consign. Quotations are: -Prime Dement*, 30s ta 32s 6U per ton (bags iv) ; medium, 25s to 27s 6 1 ; kidneys (dull), 25s to 45*.

172,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,99,THE PUBLIC ABATTOIRS.,"THE COUNTY COUNCIL CONSENTS TO THE SITE. At tbe monthly meeting of the Taieri County Council, hold on Friday, the principal bui-iaess had relation to the City Council's o implication for leave to erect a public abattoir in the county. Cons'deration of this question had been deferred from the previous meeting of the Council. A letter was read from tha Ma^or of Dunedin stating that the distance of the abattoir when erected would be three chains, and probably more, from the rradline. The Town Clerk, Dunedin, forwar-led, under Btal, the City Council's resolution to iademuify the county council from any- action or conse quences tbat might aiiie from the erection of th« abattoir in the county. A further letter from the Mayor of Dunedin stated thab since the last meeting of the county cquecH he had written to Mr Pinkcrton, requesting him to obtain, if possible, the opinion of tho law officers of the Crown aa to the kgal interpretation of clause 7 of the Abattoirs Act in relation to clause 3, »nd aleo requesting him, if their opinion ws adverse to the opinions received from Messrs Smith, Chap man, Sinclair, and White and from Mr Haggitt, to obtain an amendment of the ac!) dm ing the present seasion to make the matter clear, and hs bad received the following telegram from MrPinketton :—"": — "" Solicitor general fully agrees with your solicitor?, and says special provision of section 7 controls general terms of section 3 ; Government advifed by Crown law ofß'.ers no necessity for ameiidiug legislation."" Cr Anihikw, in accordance with notice, moved — "" That the application of the Dunedin City Council to eiwcb a public abattoir on sections 35, 36, 37, 38, Lower Kaikor<ii district, now receive the consc-nt of the Taieri County Council, provided the Dunedin City C ;uncil will uudcrbake the defence of and indemnify the county council against any suit or action at law or other consequences which may bo brought! against it or arise from its action in giving consent."" He explained tbat when he gave his notice of motion the r«eolutioa of the City Council to indemnify the counby council had not been passed. Cr Samsov agked that an opinion or two which had been handed in might be read. Ihe Clerk men'ioncd that two objections had nlf.o been received. Mr D. D. Macdonald, solicitor, wrsfco no*ify ing the council on behalf o« Mr Robert Turner, of Lower. Kaikorai, that the latter objected to any consent being given to the erection of abattoirs at Bumside. Mr Turner was the owner of certain laud in the immediate vicinity of the proposed Bite, and he considered that its value would be deteriorated by the erection of abattoirs. Moreover, he was advised that the council had no power to give such consent. In' the event of consent being given be would take legal proceedings for the purpose of obtaining redress. Mr J. R. Thornton, solicitor, wrote on behalf' of Mrs. Mackay, of Green Island, .pointing. out that aparb from all legal considerations there were< J Beriouß cbji>ctious to tho establishment of an abattoir on the proposed site. They were all aware of the tffecb of tho sm.-ll of blood on horses, and as the suggested site stocd between two public roads, and horses would bo passing and repassing every hour of the day, there was no doubt if the abattoir was established as pro posed, it would bo an endless Bonr.ce of serious accidents. The opinions of Messr3 J, R. Thornton and J. F. M. Fraser, obtained by Cr Samson, were then read. Mr Thornton's opinion was to the effect that it would not .bo lawful for the City Council with the consent of the Taieri County to establish an abattoir' on a site which was not only within the Taieri County but also within a' distance of half a miln from the nearest boundary line of the Borough of Caversham. Should the-couuty council go through the form of granting its consent to the erection of abattoirs within half a mile of a borough such consent would' be in law a nullity. If instead' of selecting, a site near Caversham, tha City Council shou'd select a site within half: a mile of Mosgiel, and asked for oonsFnt to such a site, could it be said that the law allowed the city of. Duuedio, even with the consent of the Taieri County Council, to compel* Mosgiel to endure a nuisance so established P He was of opinion that the law exprefsly prohibited such a proceeding, and if' his contention was light with reference to Mos giel, it must ba right with referenoato Caver eh.im. Mr Eraser's opinion was to the effect that the proposal to erect abattoirs on the pro posed site, which' was within half a mile of a borough bouudary, was illegal. The re medy would be by ivj unction. He might mention that personal liability for coats might be incurred by councillors and that an indem nity given to induce councillors to commit an illegality was not enforceable. Cr »Snow, in seconding Cr Andrew's motion, said it waii-their duty to gr»!>t the request of the City Council for the le^Hon thtt the question had been d'ssussed for many years, aud the people of Dunedin had dcmsujdtd inipeclion of s'aughterhouses, and the City Council had straightforwardly said that the county council ehould be at no loss on account of. what the latter did. What were they osnaidering ? It was not a matter for two or thres people, but a matter, for 40,000 or 50,000 people. If' Cr Samson said it was right th»t,»lau'gh*ef ing pre mises should be inspected, why suould they oppose tbe action of the City Council? Mr Samson said if thera was ever a time in bin life when he wajated to say a word or two in earnest, that time had arrived now. He might say, by way of porsonal explanation, that as he 1 was an extensive s'anghtermau, and as thin' proposed abattoir would be a concern of* an ex tensive nature in the sirne line, the general public had apparently made np their minds that the only view he took of the matter- was a merely selfish, view. That was not so, because he really did'cot care if the City Council built 50 abattoirs instead; of one, for they would be working undir the same aot as he, and it would be a simple case of competition ; and he was per ' fect'y satisfied to fcice tbe competition, because he knew that the City Council oould not cater for tie public as Samson aud Sons could .do. The City Council's indemnity simply meant this, that if they could get the Mayor of Dnn edin for once to speak the whole truth, he (Mr Fish) would nay, *' We know we are asking you to do an unlawful ac'j, but we are prepared to indemnify you under tho belief that no rate payers, are game to enter an action agaimt m."" Referring to the legal opinions which v had been read to the council, he said that the opinions of Mr Haggltt and Messrs Smith, Chap man, Sinclair, and White were only half hearted ; but the opinion* of Me«sr» Stout,. Mondy, and Sim, of Mr Thornton, and Mr Fraeer went direct; to the point, and fi»id distinctly what the council oould and could not do in the matter. His wh'»le reason for getting the opinions which he had obtained was to fortify the councillors with the law on the matter, so' that they would not forca auy ratepayer into the position of having to go to a higher court ogainat the whole city of Dunedin. He pointed out that; in tbe case of an ordinary license to any person applying for permission to establish an abattoir- the lioen«« was granted for 12 month*, and if at the end of that term it turned out tbat the abattoir wa3 a nuisance to the locality, ell tKat the residents had to do was to Berxd out a petition to have the license taken away ; but if this consent was given to the city of Dunedin it meant tbat the county council gave up all control over the portion of the county on which the works were erected, and if the abattoir became a ruisance for all time the county council coald do nothing to remove it. Apart from the Jpgal aspect of' the matter, he said it wan not a proper site, cud even had the site been beyond the half-mile a petition would have been got! up to try and stop tbe abattoir beiug built on it. The site was between two roads, and consisted of about 10 or 12 acrea of land. According to tbe mayor's own estimate^ it was iutended to kill 180 to 200 he,ad of cattle, 2000 odd Bheap, and 100 odd piga a week; and he (CrSamson) asked where the stock was to be kept during the week from sale to sale; They would have to be kept in paddocks all j-ound the place, and-in a district where one said a week was a nuisance it would be a great nuis* anco, as well as involve great' destruction to the roads, to have stock travelling along the roxdfl every day in thfl week. Alluding to the remarks muds by the raiyor at the previous meeting of the council, he said that Mr Fish knew he vras asking tho county council to do an illegal thiog, and was trying to hoodwink them into d dng it. Cr Snow had left it; to be inferred that if his (Cr Samson's) vote had b'ea taken ik would have been all right ; but the speaker could assure the couucil that, though hin landlord did offer the site, he had made other arrangements, and he intended to be a slangh l erm*n whether the City Council had an abattoir or not. Cr Chisiiolm said that notwithstanding all the advice th»fc had been proffered gratuitously by Mr Samson and from other ponrces he saw no reason to influfir.cn him in acting in any way othef than he had indicated at the previous meeting. Tho objections which had be.en read were more for the consideration of tin City Council th«n fdr the county council, to let the former body see what the objections were that they would have to encounter when they proceeded to erect the abattoir. He pointed oufc ttfab no obfssfcion had been received from either the Borough of Morn;ngton or from that of Cavercham, and the objections which had been received wrre of a flimsy character. In •rpply to what Cr gamnon had said, be main tained that if whoever erected an abattoir com mitted a nuinance there was provision for redress under the act. He did not attach any weight to the suggestion of personal liability attaching to members of the county council. He thought the indemnity of the City Council was snfficient to prot»ct them from liability. Cr Harrison said it seemed to him as a lay man th»t to build an abattoir within half a mile of a borough was illegal, and he thought, therefore, the council would do wrong if it granted the city the right to boild within that distance of Caverahdm. There was plenty of room in the Taieri County and around Dun edin, which could be secured for a site without any risk being incurred of breaking the law; Cr Todd thought that the fact that there was not to bd mnoh land connected with the abattoir would lead to a nuisance being created. The Chairman (Cr Graham) asked if the council wished to hear the mayor. Cr Samsoh objected. Cr Andrew said that all the arguments used by Cr Samson confirmed him in 1 his view of the case. He believed they were quite within their legal rights in the matter. He pointed out that before long (hey might see Mornington and Cavcrsham amalgamated with Dunedin, and then the abattoir would be. within the city boundary. Mr Fith wa« about- to address the' council, when Or Samson^ objected: Cr Andhew said that it was always tho cutt >m to hear a deputation. Cr Samson replied that there was no deputa tion present. The mayor had come of his own free will and had not been iuvibed. Mr Fish saia all he wished to say was that the opinion from the Solicitor-general backed up the opinions of Mir Chapman and"" Mr Hag gitt. On the motion of Cr Coishoi.m> it was n greed, Cr Samson dissenting, to hear the mayor if he wished to be heard. Mr Fish- said the letter he. had written that dny contained the essence of the ouiniou given ' by. the Solicitor-general to Mr Piukorfcon. He was extremely grieved to hear Or Samson impute to a gentleman holding the lrgh position of Mayor of. Dunedin tlut he would kuowiogty use his iuflu^nce to induce the council to commit an illegal act. If be hvi the least personal doubt ou Ihe mutter ho could' assure the council he would not condescend 'to ask them to do what he- knew to bo illegal. As to the fear of a. nuisance, he astu;ed them tho abattoir would be elected on the most improved scientific principle 3 , snd no nuisnr.ee would arise. The fact that in Edinburgh the abattoir was in the centre of the town aud there was lo nuisance disposed of the idea that a nuisance would be created 1 ; Hit if a. nuisance was committed it was-, expressly, provided in the act that the council would be indictable for it. The Chairman said the legal opinions in favour of tho application left an- uncertainty on his mind. He thought that with the number l of sites that were put under 1 offer to the City Council it was a pif-.y they did cot choote one there- could be no doubt aVoufc. The site selected was convenient to the saleyards, bnfc it was not convenient to cimping paddock*, and a nuisance' would be caused by too stock haviDg to travel along the reads. The site was, rnore ever, on the side of ""a public highway, and, though he had no doubt the abattoir would be conducted as cleanly as possible,- the smell of blood would get about, and such a smell was very offensive to animals. Where the slaughter ingtfor the city and suburbs was being centred in one part, he thought it , would have boen better if a site had been selected below the township of G«en Island — in the vicinity of Messrs Murray, Roberts, and Co. 'a fellmoiigcry, for instance — so that tbe drainage might flow to sea,- instead of being selected above the town* »hip. He had been a little swprieed that the psople of Green Fsland had not themselves t»ktn action in the. matter. Taking all things into consideration, he could not aeo his way to support the application. The motion was carried by 5 votes to 3, the voting being : For— Crs Chisbolm, Snew, Nichol, Todd, and Akidrew ; againtt — the chairman, Crs Harrison and Sanuou.",0,-3.071832845,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The.c g-Sn.lenien immediately on their arrival waited on his Excellency on board the Luna, and congratulated him upon his advent to the Northern Capital. The party remained on board till the Vice regal party were ready to dis-ernbark which was a fow minutes after ten o'clock There was no coremony of any kind at tho landing The illustrious party walked straight to the train* and having taken thoir seat., the ""train started and came straight through to Auckland. The demonstration at Onehunga was not very enthusiastic. Mr Hardington's hotel was decorated with flics, and there was a concourse of perhaps 200 people who gave three cheers for the Governor. I RECEPTION AT F()RT BRITOMABT. I The preparation-for his Excellency's recep tion were made at the Britomard railway station. Here on the platform at 10 o'clock the Volunteers mustered and formed line iv •he following order, beginning on the right :— The Engineers under Captain Anderson, I ieuteuant Kitchen, and Sub-Lieutenant Saunders. Tho Victorias under Captain Derrom, and Sub-Lieutenant Skinner. The Eobson Company under Sub-Lieuten ant Connolly. No. 3 Company under Captain Morrow and Lieut. Kelly. The N.-ival Brigade, under Captain Leßoy and Sub-Lieut. Parker. The Anckland SootHsh, under Captain Mowbray and Lieut. Mcuennan. The Nixon Light Horse, under command of Captain A. TO. Isaa.s and Lieut Calvert, were drawn up in line on the east Bide of the Breakwater road ready to foim a guard of honor to his Excellency. The whole of the Volunteers were under the command of Major Go don. The Band of the Engineer, under Band master Jtnpey, and the Victoiia Good Templar Band under Bandmaster McComi.h and Seageant Trayes were stationed jn the extreme right of the line. In the centre of the pi .tform,the reception party assembled shortly berore the arrival of his Excellency. This consisted of His Worship the Mayor (Benjamin Tonka, Esq). Header G. Wood, E_q , Provincial Treasurer, Captain Daldy, Chairman of the Harbour Board, and the following members of the City Council and Harbour Board :- Messrs. C. Yen der Heyde, J. Buchanan, H. Brett, W. J. Hurst, E. Isaacs, J. Cosg>ave, G. Holdship. The Town Clerk (Mr P. A. Philips), wis also in attendance. The general public assembled ronnd the station, and in Breakwater Hoad and Custom House-etree-, to tbe number of about 500. The special train conveying His Kxoe'iency arrived punctually at half-pasc ten the time set for its ai rival. His Excellency and the Marchioness of Normanby occupied a centre carriage, ac companied by Bishop Cowie. Frederick Whitaker, Esq.. M.H P., Captain Heale, and Dr John L. Campbell. His Excellency's suite occupied a separate cariiage, and con sisted of Lord Phipps, A. D O, and Captain Malan, Private Sec. As the train drew up the Volunteers presented arms and the bands played the first strain of the National Anthem. His Excellency at once alighted and cor dially shook hands wi.h his Worship and the other gentlemen assembled to welcome him, and mutual felicitations were ex changed His Warship then said : ""Your Excel lency, On behalf of the citizens of Auck land, J have great pleasure in welcoming yourself and Lady Normanby back among us. We trust that your stay may be a long ono, and I can assure your Excellency that nothing on our part shall be wanting to make it so."" His Excellency replied : ""On behalf of Lady Normanby and myself, allow me to express the pleasure we feel in returning to Auckland aud meeting this warm reception. On my last visit I as.urred you that I should take the earliest opportunity of raakint» a lons stay in Auckland, and now I hope to be able to remain here two or three months,"" Three hearty cheers were called for and given for "" His Excellency the Governor."" ""<>ne cheer more"" was given for the Mar chioness of Normanby. Tbe Vice-regal party then walked to their carriages, which were drawn up at the end of the platform. When the open carriage conveying his Excellency and the Marchioness of Nor manby reached the detatchment of cavalry, Sergeant Martin and two troopers assumed the position of oat-riders in advance of the carriage, and the remainder of the troop fell behind it. Thus esco ted the vice-regal party and suite, who followed in two other carriages, drove at a rapid pace to Govern ment House, via Custom - house - street, Queen - street, Shortland-street, Princes s'treet, and Waterloo Quadrant. The reception was cordial without being enthusiastic, and was evidently dictated by the feelings of loyalty, which our citizens have always manifested towards her Majesty the Queen. The moment of His Excellency's arrival at Oovernment House was notified by the commencement of a vice-regal salute of 17 guns from the Auckland Aitillery. Fags surmounted the houses in various parts of the city, and the ships in harbour were decorated in like manner. The carriages wero provided by Mr Quick in the tip-top style which usually character ises his turn-outs. Rather an amusing incident occurred when the procession reached the corner of Custom house-street <-nd the Breakwater road. At that point, as our readers ar« aware, Mr Dempsey, the contractor, has a large number of men at work. Whether by preconcerted arrangement or not we cannot; say, at any rate the idea bore the impress of spontaniety, but when his Excellency's carriage hove in sight the men with general consent knocked off work and hastily formed up in line on the side of the road. One of them assumed command, and gave the order "" present arms "" In an instant every ""pick"" was brought to the shoulder, and the motions of a royal salute were gone through with these quaint arms. As the Governor's carriage passed, the' navvies gave three hearty cheers for the Marquis of Normanby and the Marchioness of Normanby, and added directly afterwards "" Three groans for Dr Pollen "" The discor dant sounds intended for these were being given when one of the men who had been looking intently for the Honorable doctor, burst out with "" Why where the devil is he ?"" The men were taken aback for a moment by the non-appearance of the late Premier, but the exclamant of the above question soon came to the rescue with — "" Well it doesn't matter whether he's here or not, we'll hoot him all the same,"" and hoot him they did",0,-3.076660504,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/auckland-star/1876/02/17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Inspector reported that the continued wet weather had made the unm-fculled portions of the roads very soft for traffic, the worst portions beiDg the Wangaloa roads and a portion near Waihola, which had bean repaired. The me^llc-d portions of the roads were being repaired by spreading mainreuance uaetal where required. One of the coutr&obs on Table Hill road ia nearly completed, aud the others are making progress as the weather permits. The Clarksvile drainage works are also at a stand still, while the Clarendon drainage works ars now completed, and the water in the cretk has been kept within its bounds daring the past wet weather. One of the side drains leadiog to May's house, under Matau drainage works, is also finished, but it is intended to carry it a few chains further. The lakes drainage works were stopped by the wet weather, and the lakes rose up to the ordinary winter level before the rain stopped ; but they have sinca fallen very rapidly. A strong current is still running through the canal into the river, which has kept it at a low level for some wteks past The beams have given way on one of the bridges over Tokomairiro river near Clymer's. New ones have been ordered, and the work of re placing them will be commenced as soon as the timber arrives. Beams have also been delivered for the bridge over Stony creek on Main South road, and the works will be commenced when the weather moderates. New beams have also been placed on. bridge over Morrison's creek. Two wood bridges bave huen laid over the Cl&rksville m&in drain, and demands have been m*de For more bridges over same A new bridge has also been placed over Southbridge drain on road leading past Mrs M. Begley's. Timber has been delivered to replank some of the large culverts on the ""Wangaloa road. The heavy coal and timber trade still continues on Wangaloa and Kaitangata to BJcluthi roads. Several names h»ve been handed to tha county solicitor for breaking the by-laws, and the cases will be heard at the first sitting of the court at Milton. The works on road through block VI, Clareadon district, under Government vote, have been delayed by the wet weather, and they are not yet completed.

They bad b'.eu promised a Government grant of £200, and it was decided that Bruce Couuty contribute two-tbirds of the balance up to £200 and Taieri County one third up to £100. An estimate had been pre pared which showed the probable cost of the work to be £+64-.

82,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,9,AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL NEWS.,"Mr John Cowan has supplied the Cromwell Argus with detailed particulars concerning the cost of keeping, down rabbits for the past five years on the Nor th burn and K<twarau runs. From this it appears 'tut on the Norbhburn station an average of 12 men has been engaged during the period, the loss on skins for the five years totalling £938 5s 6d. On the Kawarau station with an average of 59 men the loss has reached the large total of £6780 2s 7d in five years, or an average of £1358 0a 6d per annum. The annual report of the Wellington Meat Export Company shows that, after writing off £1809 from building and machinery and addiog £1500 to reserve, a profit is shown of £3055. A dividend of 6 per cent, is recommended. A dairy factory is to be started at Rivers dale. The guarantee fund raised by the Southland Frozen Meat Company, with the object of securing the company's baDk overdraft of £20,000, now reaches £23,000. From the April number of the South African Agriculturist we learn that Mr R. P. Cooper, chief of the well-known firm of sheep- dip manufacturers, has made a valuable gift to the Cape farmers. This gentleman is the pro prietor of one of the finest stud Shropshire flocks in England, and out of this flock fche owner shipped a selection of fix rams as a present to the Port Elizabeth Agricul tural Society's Exhibition, who exhibited them at their lasS April show. Mr Cooper paid all expenses of every kind attend ing the gift, and seat one of his own shepherds to look after the rams on the voyage. The con dition of the gift was that at the conclusion of the show these valuable sheep were to be dis tributed gratuitously among the most represen tative sheepfarmers of the colony on their bind ing themselves to send pens of the- resulting lambs to the subsequent exhibitions of the Port Elizabeth agricultural show. One of the reasons given the R&ngitikei Advocate by a gentleman — who is himself a successful iheepbreeder — for the breakdown of the sheep market in Sydney is that the New Zealand sheep sold there last year are not doing well. The difference in climate and the chances of feed are very great aB between the two countries, and our heavy, long-woolled sheep would be at a disadvantage on poor feed alongside the merino, which travels far in search of feed, and is a good forager. The result of the shipment of five tons of potatoes per the s.s. Tongariro, which were shipped in that vessel for Rio de Janeiro, but which had to be taken on to London in conse quence of quarantine regulations, should (says the New Zealand Mail) embolden the potato growers of New Zealand to consider whether a trade might not be opened in this esculent. The report on the potatoes referred to reads thus :— "" The potatoes have arrived in excellent order, and are pronounced to be of superb quality, boiling into balls of flour."" When the experiment of shipping potatoes to London was tried a few years ago it was not a success, but it must be remembered that much greater facilities are now available for carrying' such perishable goods as the potato. That they can be carried successfully has now been demonstrated. All that is now required is organisation ensuring a continuous and regular supply. It is probable that our early varieties would be the most suit able. New Zealand potatoes would be in demand for a change of seed. The P. and W. Times says:— ""Mi- J. Withey, of Goodwood, lost three valuable cows in full milk last week under somewhat peculiar circumstances. The cows were running in the Goodwood busb, and the supposition is that they were poisoned by eating some wild barr:e3 which are known to be poisonous. mWe under stand that Mr Bruce, inspector of stock, on being informed of the death of the cattle, had them opened, with the object, we believe, of forwarding portion of fche stomach to Welling ton for analysis by the Government veterinary uurgeon, Mr Gilruth, whose opinion will no doubfc be anxiously looked for."" Nearly all the hands on the Waihao Downs station have been dispatiscd with (says the Waimate Times). As a considerable number were employed, the ourtailing of labour on fctw estate will mean a lessening of basinets to many of the tradesmen of the town. Mr James Jellie, stock and station agent, of Wsrrnambool, is, says the Australasian, nego tiating with a shipping firm with a view of gat ting a steamer to call at Melbourne for 100 live bullocks and 500 sheep for the London market. A firm at Home has written Mr Jtllie stating that there is a good and profitable market foL* Australian bullocks if only the proper quality beasts are sent. They have given an order for 100, to be sent at once. The bullocks will be shipped if a steamer can call here, bat the chief difficulty in the way is the inadequate accom modation at the breakwater. The Queensland Government has decided to i«Bue a proclamation, under the Diseases in Animals Act, providing for the application o£ the tnberculme test in the case of cattle, and the mullein test for hones, arriving in Queens land from any place beyond the Australian colonies, Tasmania, and Now Zealand. If any do not comply with such tests thay will be returned whence they were shipped or destroyed. Me G. H. Cox, in an address delivered at the Sydney sheep show held recently, stated that 98 years ago the number of sheep in Austr&Usia was 1536 ; to-day the number is 128 million. In the whole world the num ber is 575,000,000. These figures show that Australasia possesses nearly 21 per cent, of the world's live stock in sheep The yield of wool in Australasia is 675.C00,0001b ; the yield of wool in the world is 2,400,000,0001b. Australasia is thus shown to bs the most proliflo country in the world for wool-growing, for, while it owns 20 per cent, of the world's sheep, it produces over 28 per cent, of the whole quantity of wool grown. It is evident (says the Qaeenslander) that crossbreeding in sheep is not to be very largely, entered upon in Australia, otherwise the large numbers of splendid coarse-woolled sheep sub mitted at the recent Sydney sheep sales would not have been allowed to be sacrificed at suoh ruinously low prices. Some yery superior Lin coln, Leicester, and Roraney Marsh sheep from New Zealand and Tasmania sold at a few shillings, and in some instances whole consignments did not realise suf ficient to pay their, owners' hotel bills. Whether the recent rise in msrino wools had an influence on the prices obtaiasd for coarse woolled sheep, or the opinion is pretty general that much of the Australian pasture is unsuited to that description of sheep, it is hard to say ; but certain it is that those that were sold w«nt into comparatively few hands. It is probable that until the cultivation of grasses is more generally adopted here the breading of heavy mutton sheep will be but sparingly carried on. The French Minister at Copenhagen has re* cently published an interesting report upon the daily industry in Denmark. As regards the treatment of the milk, he states that the process in general use is to pour it into large tin pails, which are plunged either into cold water or into water mixed with ice or* snow, which lowers the temperature almost to zero. Thus the milk is better preserved, and the skim ming can be conveniently made much sooner. He explains that there are two kiuds of Danish butter that which is made of tha cream which is collected as soon as it rises, and which is called sweet batter (sddt smdr), and that made with the cream that has been allowed to sour » little, and which is known as tour butter (syrnet smtir). This latter kind is much more delicate, and is quoted as high as 194-fr for 50 kilogrammes. The greater part of it is exported. In the manufacture of this butter a conical-shaped churn with a vertical axis, containing ia the interior three churns placed vertically to arrest the giratory oaoremeat of the cream, is em ployed. The butter when made is packed in little wooden barrels, containing 14, 18, or 36 kilogrammes. The Danish ""pund"" is equi valent to half a kilogramme (11 02lb avoir dupois). The export of Dauish butter has increased from 24,000,000 kilogrammes in 1837 to 49,000,000 kilogrammes in 1893. That Central Queensland will yet become the granary of Australia is predicted by file C. Hayes, managing director of the Queens land Milling Company. According to Mr Hayes, as interviewed by a representative o£ the Brisbane Courier, while there are patches of wheat land between Rockhampton and Emerald, the land from Emerald to Clermont on the one hand and to Springsure on the other is one vast wheat field. From Barcaldine to Longreach the land is described as simply per fect. Even the country around Alpha and Bogantungan, poor only in the want of natural water, would, in favourable seasons, grow from 20 to 25 bushels per acre (about double tha yield of New South Wales and nearly doubla that of South Queensland) of a high-qu»lity wheat. In short, stretching across the middle of the colony there is a wheat belt so large and so fertile that, according to Mr Haye3, iij should become one of the great granaries of tha world. He anticipates the time when thou sands of farmers will make their homes there, and when wheat, exported in enormous quan tities, will take the place of wool as a staple crop. So sure is he of success that he has de cided to make a beginning by erecting a mill at Emerald. Mr A. R. Long, near Shepp&rton, has, lays the Melbourne Leader, had an experience in the making of ensilage which suggests that sor&e times very satisfactory results may be secured with a very slight expenditure of trouble. la his orchard last season he had a growth of grass and weeds so luxuriant that it took a man a ceuple of days to cut the six acres. The Stuff included iron weed and some spear frags. Mr Long carted it to a corner of the orchard and stacked it. He did not expect it to be of any value, but by way of experiment pressed down the stack with firewood, which was lying handy. At the outset the stack was about 10ft high, 12ft long, and Bft wide, but it lank to a little over 3ft ; to his great surprise, when he came to deal with it, Mr Long found that he had ensilage, which the cows eat greedily, and of which not more than half a load at the outset is bad. The stuff was put away in a rainy season, and no trouble was token with it.",0,-3.100992863,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

118,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,45,THE WEEK'S MINING NEWS.,"At Nuggety Gaily, near D&ylesford, Victoria, Mr George Brown, a miner, made the lucky discovery hut month of a nugget estimated to contain 238uz of gold. The discoverer foe the past three years has worked small blocks of alluvial left from the early days with varying lucir. At Easter last he unearthed another nugget weighing 240z 7dwt, but for 12 months he did not* make £5 by following his fortunes on Nuggety Gully. The facts of the find, as related by Mr Brown, briDg back- to memory (says the Argus) the history of several similar discoveries. ""It was the last stroke of tho pick did it. I was just en the po'nt of abandoning the claim, having worked out the simll bit of ground left there, but a piece of overhanging ground close against the old workings at t- acted my attention. I gave it a hit with the pick ; it Bounded queer, bo I at once knew there wag something more than w&shdirt there. And, snre enough, when I picked out tho side I got fair on to the nugget and brought it downf~ I need not tell you that I didn't wait long in the hoe but got home as qnickly rr possible, much to the delight of my wife. I brought the lump straight down to Melbourne and Hold it."" The discovery was made at a depth of 12ft from the Burfsca. Nuggety Gully has produced several large nuggets, the latest being the fourth largest. The others contained respectively 521b, 281b, and 301b weight of gold. Mr Bush, S.M., at Auckland inDicted a fi.ie of £30, and £1 1*3 costs, oa Jame3 G:lmour on a charge of executing a transfer of certain slisxes without the name of the purchaier being •written in ink. It was contended that the company was registered in Sydney, and shares were not transferable here. Mr Bush said that the document should be stamped. He took time to consider whether the document ehould be restored. On one side of the docu meat is scrip for 100 shurcs, and on the othsr Bice the transfer. -- A gold dredging company, with a capital of £5000, in £1 shares, is being formed to work the auriferous course of the Mataura river. Mr J. Knight, the originator itnd prospector cf the company, obtained, at the last sitting oi the Warden's Court, the right or prospector's license for a mile of the river bed, beginning jusb beyond Gordon. Our Auckland correfpendent uritrs: — Mining matters still remain bi-t.vk, and ths Mining Exchange filled with dabb'ers in sc.ip, from the juvenile clerk in a mercantile office to the clork who has his "" little flutter,"" but does not wish his name mentioned by the reporters. A study of the faces of the crowd who haunt the sharebrckera' offices is a refreshing pastime for Jihe cynic. . English capital is still coming in for investment, and keeps the b&ll merrily rolling. A mild scare was created by the aunounce ment that ihe Government intended to enforce the regulations of the Mining Act jus to fully msßniig the mining areas which had b.ea, pegged off and floated 09 the market. The Government, however, has apparently he'd its hand, and further time will be allowed to get together ihe plant and machinery necessary for efficiently working mines on the Thames and Coromandel penin sula, earning summer should see a lot of prospectiog done, as, owing to the broken character of the ranges, clothed with densd forest, a large tract of country is still unknown to the miners, and its auriferous resources un ,teßted. Until this territory is pierced with prospecting tracks from end to end it will be .impoEsible to determine the full character and extent of the Thames Go'dfields, and determine even approximately their future permanence. A very prebty nugget, weighing 290z, was gold at Dun-jily (Victoria) by a young man, who got it in some old workings at Waanyarra. The following items are from the Tuapeka Times : — The recent hard frosts, and the conse quent scarcity of water for mining purpo3ec, are seriously felt among the nvners in the distiict. Last week the Consolidated Company, Blue Spur, was able to work only for a few houis owing to the water race being froz :n. Tha wagas paid for labour last month by the company fell jEIOO below tha usual expenditure for that psriod, and it is probable that the wages bill for the current month will be even smaller because of the broken weather and the insufficiency of the water aupply at the disposal of the company. This ii, of course, bad for the company, but even worse for -the men, whose me^ns of livelihood defend absolutely on their daily labour, and if this is interfered with, as it has been to so very serious an extent in this instance, aud no doubt in many similar cases in the district from the same causes, the results niuet be f<r from comforting during the present inclement weather. Farmers alao have reason to cornplaic. ; but their circumstances are not quite so hard as those of working minera, whose daily wage constitute their entire sourca of sup port. — Mr C. C. Rawlins was successful while at the seat of government recently in inducing the Miuister for Mines to agree to advance one-third of the cost of construction of the United Hercules water race to Dumbarton Rock. It may be ex plained that it is the intention of those who are applying for the water rights of the Hercules Cjinpany. now in liquidation, to work a special claim nt Dumbarton Rock belonging to Mr J. F. Kilching, the enterprise to be undertaken on the co-operative principle. The assistance promised by the Minister for Mines will take the form of a gntnt-in-aid, on condition that the race will bs constiucted on the co-operative principle, which is exactly what thoBQ interest •d intend doing. The men employed on the raca will be allowed so much per week in cash, the balance to stand against their shares, with alao the further guaran tee that they will get work in the mine when the enterprise has reached that stage. The under taking deserves every success, and we are glad to learn that Mr Cadmau has taken so favourable and generous a view of it.— Our Miller's Fiat cor respondent writes :— "" The river is now very low, a«d if there should be a continuation of the frost it will reach an unusually low level."" The Press has the following :— "" A Mr C. Hardy, a young Aucklander, in letteis to his father, gives some interesting particulars of his experiences on the West Australian goldfields. He and his party had not very long previou»ly reached the Lake D*rlot field, 280 miles from Co olgardie, after a very rough trip, so rough that though they started early for the spot they did not reach it until 1000 men were on the ground and the gold was worked out. It was a very patchy field, out of which a lot of gold was ob tained in a short time, some 600oz being picked up on the surface The three prospectors who found it got 180cz in two days, but on ihe third day two of them wtre speared by the blacks, so that it was an unprofitable venture so far as they were concernel. As has always been the case, a great rush sat in to Lake Darlot on the r port 3of gold haying been found reaching Coolgardia, but the auriferous deposit wai very hhallow, tho field was soon overcrowded, and later arrivals were shut out. Wages, we learn, were £5 a week on the reefs, but so they needed to be with water at 6d a gallon, and provisions at despirate famine prices. Eef tring to the latter que»tiju Mr Hardy says :— ' We had a big "" roll up "" a week ago to bring down the price of pro visions. The storekeßpers were charging £3 3s for a 501b bag of flour, butter 4s 6d a pound, mmts 3s, bacon 33 6d, potatoes 3* fid, candles Is each and so on. Diggers he*rd that several camel teams were on the road with stores, so they called a roll-up to consider matter---, the result beingthat a committee wa3 appointed to confer with the storekeepers. They offered the store keepeis fiO par cent, profit on the Cool g-udie retail prices, ani the cost of carriage up h.er-3 from Coolgardie, £80 per ton._ Teese terms were accepted, and it made a big difference in prices.' The storekeep?rs, after sll, ate the only people who are almost certain to make money on a gold field, and they would have been very greedy at Lalce Darlot if they had not agreed to ihe diggers' liberal teiim, though we do not quit.) sec what the later would have dona if their offer had been refused. At the time Mr Hardy wrote Mew Guinea was being discussed on all hancs, and several nicn were leaving to goprospc-ct ine there. Poor though their chances of making a livelihood in Western Australia might be, it is doubtful if they could batter them by going fo such a place as New Guinea Of a ruiuer, however, more than any man, it may be said that he 'never is, bat always to be ble3t,' and it is, on the whole, fortunate for him that he has such a profound hope of striking it rich some day. The d<;l'ghtfal prospect carries him happily through tho disap pointment of a 'duffer,' which is too often his lot."" The Round Hill correspondent of the Western Star agitates for the construction of a channel from Rouni Hill to the sea. He write* :— "" Why not a Government channel ? 1 sec by the press that a great many are out of emploj ment and that great and generous efforts arc being made to find work for them. No doubt the bt-autifying of towns by the money so raired relieves at the time, but it will be of nolßstingbe»efitto the employees. It rather encourages men to hang about the street corners, resting assured they will notbs p.llowed to starve. Tboso who are' trying to place them on the goldfields are the men who have my sym pathy. Well, fcir, I see by a return that a water race near Kumara constructed by the Govern ment is paying 12i per cent, on its construction. Surely that is a long way better than leaving the ground i'lle, and it is returning good value for the moLcy expended to the people of New Zealand. We hive such a race at our very doors and never a word raised about it. I sincerely hope that some abler pen than mine will take the matter up. The race in quetti-m would take fall up from the sea along Ourawera creek to the Round Hill. The cons' ruction of this channel would give em ployment to thousands of men, who by the charges paid by them for emptying their tailings into it would pay a good percentage on the cost of con stiuction. It is evident that something will have to be dono to this creek, as the railway will shortly be sludged over. The necessity of raising half a mile of railway would go a long way towards constructing the channel. With re 1 gard to . the reefs in the Longwood, there is no doubt that they do exist. But there ii the point in the Ourawera Flat, Round Hill, and the adjacent country, where it is well known that good payable gold exists if it could only be got at. The taking up of the channel by the Governmentis the only practicable way for making it a success to all."" We learn fiom the Tuapeka Times that at the last meeting of the Miller's Flat Mining Associa tion it was resolved, on the motion of Mr Ballantyne, to endorse ths recommendation of the Mount Ida Mining Association requesting the Government to call Mr Jno. Werner to the Legis lative Council as a representative of the mining interests of Otogo.— A letter was received from Messrs Kitto, at present mining at the Frujd Burn, complaining of having been harshly treated by the manager of the Beaumont station, who, they alleged, had threatened that unless they removed their hut on to their claims he would insist on their piying a contribution of 2s Gd a week for the accommodation. lie had also notified them to remove their horses from off j the run, or else pay Is par we.de fur grazing. It was resolved that the secretary forward the complaint to the Hon. Mr Cndnian, Minister for Mines, for his consideration.— With reference to the complaint made by Messrs ICitt"", it appears they have a pluicing claim a couple of miles or more above a block of freehold land owned by the proprietors of the Beaumont station, and it is no doubt looked upon as certain that in time the creek will become ailted and result in injury to a considerable portion of the land. To this may probably be attributed the objection of the station manager to the presonce of the miners and his disinclination to make things as easy for them as he might otherwise be inclined to do. — The secretaiy of the Lowburn Mining Association f'.Twardsd a resolution asking the committee to support a propojal recommending that all appli catfoDS for mining claims ehould be forwarded -to the nearest mining a-sociation before being submitted to the warden. It was decided not to support such a proposal. The Auckland Weekly News eaya:— ""Another brilliant return ha 1 ? result d from the monthly cleaning up at the Hauraki Company's battery at Coromandel, for the particulars of which we are indebted to the manager, dptiin Hodge. The total quantity crushed for the month en ling Saturday was 142 tons, and the yield was 32690z of molted gold. The yield per ton in 230z, and the value of the gold at £3 per oz is the splendid total of £9807. The result is not quite equal to that obtained last m r >nth — namely, 33740z from 60 tons, and 108 ilb of tpeciinens, but it is neverthe less a magnificent yield, and further establishes the great wealth of the Hauraki re^f. Our Coro inandel correspondent, in telegraphing the result of the cleaning-up, adds that the mine is looking splendid throughout."" The Minister for Mines has proposed to mako a cutting through all the firms from the gorge to the township of Berwick, banking the low ground on either side all the way to the Tttieii lake. There is still some difficulty in obtaining the acquiescence of the various landowners to the terms laid down by the Government; but the Minis f er for Mines is still hopeful that existing difficulties may be overcome, and that an early settlement may be arrived at. The Minister has agreed to advance one-third of the cost of con struction of the United Htrcules watar race to Dumbarton Rock. It is the intention of those who are applying for the water rights of the Herculea Company, now in liquidation, to work a special claim at Dumbarton Kock belonging to Mr J. F. Kitching, the enterprise to be undertaken on the co-opsiatiye principle. The assistance promised by the Minister will take the form of a grant-ma id, on condition that the nice will be constructed on the co-operative principle. The men employed on the race will be allowed so much per weak in cash, the balance to stand agaiast their shares, wirh also the further guarantee that they will get work in the mine when the enterprise has reached that st»gß. In order to assist the men thrown out of work by the stoppage of the Waipori dredges, Mr Cad man has authorised the Tuapeka County Council to spend Between £200 and £303 in re pairing the Lawrence-Waipori road.— Tuapeka Tim ea. Mining companies in Victoria are making a determined stand against payment of the gold royalties clainied. When the Mining on Private Lands Bill was passed in 1884 the term of 11 years was fixed in which all existing mining agree ments should terminate. This term ended on July 31. As a protest against royalties and to test the question, the Madame Berry West Company on Friday stopped work under legal advice. An official decision by the Government ha 3 been asked for, and i* awaited with great interest, the majority of the companies being in open re bellion against further subsidising holders in the shape of royalties. The Dunstan Times reptn-ts that the river is now very low, and is gradually going down fctill further. Already all f-long the river bank there are parties of men working, and we are glad to be able to Btate that they are all making good wages. Hyde and party obtained 16oz at their weekly wash-up on Friday, July 26. Prospecting is still being vigorously pursued in Gippsland (says the Melbourne Age), and an application was made to the Mines department yesterday to cut a track through the country, extending up the side of the Snowy river from Orlost 011 to Mount Bawen, a distance of about 50 miles. This track, it was stated, would go through gold-beariiiDj country which had hitherto never been troddop or expo ed by white men, owing to 'its inaccessible character. A sample of gold which had been obtained by a prospector, whohadahird time in its pursuit, was taken from Creamie's creek, about 25 miles from Orlost. Many reefs were traceable all through the country, and gold could be found in severdl, but there was no possibility of the district being developed until f lf-ilities were given for exp'ora tion The Minietei for Mines said he would take into consideration ths question whether a tiack should be made. Tho Upper Waipori, Alluvial Gold Dredging Company (Limited)' obtained from No 1 dredge 20oz 9dwt of gold for 134 hours' dredgiDg last week.

393,1854-07-08,OW,Otago Witness,6,SUMMARY.,"The Despatch from Sydney by the other Settle ments brings us a large number of home and colo nial papers, with English news to the 10th March. The Queen, wearing a splendid tiara of diamonds and a diamond necklace, a white satin dress, and a train of rich claret coloured velvet, opened Parlia ment in person on the 31st January, and never be fore were there such a multitude assembled to witness the ceremony, or such a brilliant equipage attended upon royalty. Her Majesty, in her speech, with re ference to the affairs of Turkey, observed - The hopes which I expressed at the close of the last session that a speedy settlement would be effected of the differences existing between Russia and the Otto msin Porte have not been realized, and I regret to say that a state of warfare has ensued. I have continued to net in cordial co-operation with the Emperor of the French, and my endeavours, in con junction with my allies to preserve and to restore peace between the contending parties, although hitherto un successful, have been unremitting. I will not fail to persevere in these endeavours ; but. as the continuance of the war may deeply affect the interests of this country, and of Europe, I think it requisite to make a further augmentation of my naval and military forces, with the view of supporting niy representations and of more ef- I fectuully contributing to the restoration of pe""aee. The failure of the harvest in England, and the privation of the poor, Her Majesty thus notices :—: — In the year which has just terminated the blessing of an abundant harvest has not been vouchsafed to us By this dispensation of Providence the price of provisions has been enhanced, and the privations of the poor have incrensed; but their patience has been exemplary; and the carp of the Legislature, evinced by the reduction of taxes affecting the necessaries of life, has greatly tended to preserve a spirit of contentment. Active preparations for the war, both naval and military, were goins; on in England and France, and troops were being shipped off for the seat of war with all possible dispatch. The Russian Ambassa dors had left England and France, and the English and French Ambassadors are recalled from the Rus sian Court. The English and French Governments had sent an accredited plenipotentiary to St. Peters burg, demanding the evacuation of the Danubian Provinces within six days, or hostilities would be commenced; but as there was little probability of tha Emperor complying with this demand, the pre parations for war were being rigorously pursued. Orders had been issued, calling on all pensioners under 60 years of age, in whatever occupation, to attend on a certain day forinspection by the Admi ralty officers, to ascertain their fitness for service. One-half of the coast-guard, about 3000 men, had been ordered to be drafted on board various line-of battle ships. Fifty-six regiments are to be aug mented from 850 to"" 1000 rank and file. Lord Rag lan (better known as Lord Fitzroy Somerset) has been appointed to the chief command of the British troops. On the 26th Feb. the 2nd battalion of the Coldstream and the 3rd' Grenadier Guards, number ing 2000 men, embarked in three steamers at South ampton for the East ; as also the Ist battalion of Scotch Fusilier Guards in the Sitnoon, the Rifles in the Vulcan, the 93rd in the Himalaya, and the 33rd in the Cambrian. The .following regiments were under orders to hold themselves in readiness to em bark for Constantinople in March on the days stated. 4th (Kind's Own) on the 22nd; 7th (Royal Fusiliers) on the 25th ; 9th on the Oth ; 14th on the 3rd ; 17th on the 4th ; 2!ht (Royal North British Fusiliers) on the 15th; 27th (Innisk""u>n) on the 10th; 28th on the 17th; 35th on the 13th ; 38th on the 25th; 39th on the 2nd; 42nd (Royal Highlanders) on the 30th; 50th (Queens Own) on the 18th ; 62nd on the sth ; 63rd on the 7th ; 79th (Cameron Highlanders) on the 22ud ; 82nd on the 16th ; 88th (Connaught Rangers ) on the 27th ; 89th on the Ist; 90th (Perthshire Light Infantry) on the 9th; 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) on the 21st ; 90th on the 24th. The 34th, 20th, 97th, 46th, 33rd, 70th, 9 1st, 12th, 19th, and the Irish Brigade, will remain in the United King dom to do home duty. The demands of Russia, communicated by Count Orloff to the Court of Vienna, merit for their ex travagant insolence a distinct enumeration. They are four in number : — Fiist, that the Porte send to the Russian head quarters in Wallachia— not to St. Petersburgh— a, plenipotentiary authorised to offer the — "" terms "" we will not call them— but the "" submissions "" that follow. Second, that the Porte renew all former treaties with Russia, notwithstanding the flagrant violation of them by the latter power. Third, that the Porte gives an engagement not to afford shelter to political refugees-. .- ~ _ — - Fourth, that the Porte invest Russia with tHe'Pro tectorate of all the Greek Christians in its dominions. These insolent and insulting propositions were in dignantly refused by all the Western powers.—Mel bourne Morning Herald. An important item of news has been conveyed td Shanghae by the Russian war steamer Vostock— * the Russian Ambassador's interview with the Japa* nese authorities ; the latter conceding to the Rus sians a promise to open Japan to trade with the* rest of the world within a year.

A letter from the Chairman to the Miaister for Mines getting forth very fully the objects of the association, and urging the Government to grant & subsidy on any funds collected, was approved. Among the inward correspocdeace were letters from the Rev. W. H. Ash and Mr Jameß Smith. Mr Ash wrote suggesting the advisability of the association authorising its prospectors to search for coal. Mr Ath pointed out that in the interior/ many lignite deposits h>d been found, and said it would be a great boon to the country districts if bituminous ccal could be discovered. In this connection Mr Ath said that the efforts of the students of the School of Mines might well be devoted to this work. Mr Smith, in enclosing a cheque for £5, iaid he had originally intended to give that sum in augmentation of the relief works fond, but now that the project contemplated by the Miners' Association appears to have »ssumed a practical »hape, he preferred diverting his donation to the promotion of an enterprise wh'cb, in hit opinion, is far more worthy of general support, in that, instead of affording only temporary relief to the unemployed, it holds out the rea sonably encouraging prospecb of finding per manent and fairly profitable employment for a large number of men who possessed the requi site courage and self-reliance to enter on a miner's life, and thus relieving to a great extent the congested labour market of thh and other towns. A quantity of routine business was transacted, and thdPtrusless expressed their sincere regret that the Unemployed Relief Works Committee had seen fit to again decline tho a*soii*tion'a application for a grant from the fund* cub- Bcribed by the pubic.

During the hearing of the former case, Sergeant; Weidner asked his Worship whether he would grant summoases against parties after their horses had been impounded. fie said the police frequently impounded horses; the fees were small; they, ware at once paid, and the horses again turned out on the streets. Tiiere were many com plaints against horses straying at the south end of the town, and somithing more than impounding was required to put a stop to the evil.

The Western Would. — The com pletion of the milaoad across America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, makes Americans calculate on a dumber of tra vellers to visit the wonders of that which is still a new world. One of the grandest sights on the Pacific side is declared to be the Valley of she Yosemite, in the Siewa range, about 250 miles east of San Fran cisco. The first lime a white man ever entered it was in 1848, and even now the journey is"" somewhat h&ud."" The route from San Francisco is by way of Stockton, a town 110 miles due east, and this part ot the journey is done by river steamer, the next ]ol> miltis by stages, and the last 48 by saddle-horses, which in two days, the riders camping in the woods for the night, bring the travellers to Fnspiration Poinr, where the whole mag nificence of tbo Yosemi'e bursts upon the view. The valley is ten miles long and three wide. Its sides are granite walls from 2.000 ft. to 4,500 ft. high. Great domes and pyramids, rise above the deep hollow, at the bottom of which is a little lake and stream. A small river, 70ft. wide, tumbles over on one side of the im mense height, coming down in three falls^ the first of them 1,300 ft. In the valley are nooks and bits of scenery of rare beauty, contrasting almost strangely with the solemn grandeur of the surrounding walls and peaks. The spot is more than a place for summer resort, it one of the wonders of creation* It is boasted that no one ever made the trip and returned disappointed. At Stockton the tourist may turn aside, and a ride of 72 miles will bring him to the Calaveras grove of big trees. There are 92 trees, ranging in height from 150 feet to 327 feet; and from 10 feet to 30 teet iv diameter. Their age is supposed to be from 1500 to 2500 years. A tremendous panic has occured in the Gold Market of New York.

All Wall street engaged in the fi^htj securities were sold at. any price to get resources, Government stock falling 20 per cent., and trade throughout the Union stopped. Import duties are paid in gold, and while the price fluctuated nobody knew what to charge for anything. On the 24' h the Treasury sent L' 4,000,000 in gold to market to sell by auction^ the bubble burst, and most of the •' bulls"" were ruined.

Accounts could not be settled for three days, and up to the latest advices no one in the speculation knew if he was rich or ruined.

The necessity of suoh a Bill has been created by the frightful de« pteciarion of property Wherever a race* course is opened in the vicinity of thd Metropolis, and the complaints of the in habitants of the suburban districts that whenever at( meeting "" takes place the whole neighborhood is visited by a swarm of the vilest and most dangerous creatures s so that, fjr a while, no property oivperson is safe. A witness in a London police court re garding a case of alleged assault on a con stable by a woman the other dav, when asked to account tor the police taking her up, replied, "" tJpon my solemn oa'h I do i not know why they took the prisoner to the station except it was their own intoxi cation."" The 'Times' on the Colonial Policy o^ the Government.— lt is as unreasonable and unbecoming for New Zealand in its politio-.il capacity to bfg help in a domestic difficulty from Gr«at Britian as it would be' tor Berkshire to importune Oxfordshire to assist it in paying its rates. For Great Britain to grant such help would retard r he growth of the manly spirit of self-reliance without which Colonial self-gov^rnmunt is a mockery.

T&e subscriptions of affiliated club 3 amounted to £44 2«. Ths year commenced with a credit balance of £82 Bs, and that balance has been increased by about £9. *.* At the annual sports mooting of the Crewe Alexandra Club on Juue 15, the meeting in the 100 yds race of the rival sprinters, O/ A. Bradley and A. R. Downer, created lively interest and enthusiasm. The start was per frctly an even one, the three — J. W. Bradley competing with the famous pair — quitting the crease simultaneously, but the elder Bradley, who b""gan much faster than he usually does, was the fir-t to show in frout, Downer follow ing. Ha fway down the tivck there was a g»p of three-qunrtwrs of a yard between the pair, but from this point tho Euglhhman drew fur ther and yet further away, uutil he dashed through the worsted with a tremendous bur«t, the winner by a yard and a-half, in time a yard inside evens— a truly splendid performance, that will probably rrmain unparalleled, not; to say surpassed, for a long time to coma. The 350 yds Invitation Race, at the same meeting, brought out B. C. Bredin, Downer, and four othera. Downer left the mark with wonderful celerity, aud made his own running, the pace a cracker, dropping bis opponents, until half way he was some eight yards ahead of the nearest. Bredin, who i« certainly a little off colour just now, began slowly, and was headed by Elliott for over 100 yard*, alter which he went on in pursuit of Downer, who came buck along the straight, his opening dash having evidently takfu a lot out of him, but nevertheless he h*d euo«igh le t t. flnmh with, and Brediu, uuab'e to get fainy at borne, was beaten by a couple of yardo, in turn beating Taylor, the third man home, by a/similar distance. The time, 393 ec, or, to be accurate, a shade inside, was not par ticularly fast. * . • At the United Hospitals Sports on June 19, F S. Batchelor, of Dunedin, representing Guy's, ran second to A G. Butler, of St. Mary's, in the Quarter- mile Challenge Cup, the winner's time for which was 52 3-ssec. Tbe principal event of the meeting was the 1000 yds Invitation Handicap, wherein Bredin attempted to lower the record for tbe distince. He failed in his endeavour, and only mauaged to run into third place in 2min 16Jseo, which is f >ej slower than the tinio credited to Pollock Hill. * . ' The eighth annual meeting of the New Zealand Amateur A'hletic Associa tion was held at Christohurch last Friday night. Delegates were preseutfrom Auckland, North Shore, Hawke's Bay, Gisborne, Mana watu, Wellingt >n, Wanganui, Nelson, Canter bury, South Canterbury, Eurow, and Dunedin Clubs. Mr T. D. Condell, South Canterbury, was in the chair. The balance sheet showed the receipts to have been £140 3i and the ex penditure £43 15s sd, leaving a credit balance of £91 7b 7d. The report and balauoe sheet were adopted Mr F. Wilding, Canterbury, was elected president, and the presidents of affiliated club* were appointed vice-presidents. Mr L. A. Cuff was re-elected hon. secretary, and Mr E. R. Webb, hon. treasurer. Messrs J. F. Logan (Auckland) and C. A. Eoapp (Wellington) were elected local officers. M-s»re Logan aud Kriapp wei c accorded a hearty vote of thanks for past setvic s. It was resolved on the motion of Mr L. A. Caff that the New Zealand Champion ship meeting for 1895 96 be confined to clubs affiliated to the New Zealand A.A.A., and be held in Christchurch on Daoember 28, 1895. It was resolved that a meeting of delegates from the affiliated clubs be held annually in the town where tbe C&ampionship meeting i-j held for the purpose of considering questions of in terest and making recommendations to the association. It was decided (hat the athletic season commence on August 1 and end on July 31. DUNEDIN AMATEUR ATHLETIC CLUB. The tenth annual report of tho Dunedin Amateur Athletic Club for the year ending the 30th June 1895 states .— Tho cross-country run was held on v the 29th September over the usual course. Entries were good, and considerable interest whs taken in the event, the wiuner being Mr J. T. Stone, a new member, who, besides receiving first pn'ze', holds the Dr Roberts Challenge Cup for the year. The club is indebted to the Tahuna Park Recreation Company for the use of the park, and to Mrs Cutten, Messrs Taggart, Begg, and Brookes, for permitting the run to take pkee over their properties. The annual sports meeting of the club was h«ld at Carisbrook on the Bth December, and although the weather was all that could bs desired, the attendance was considerably below the average, and the m«eting resulted in a l«ss. owing partly to want of support by the general public, but principally to the extraordinaiy want of enthu siasm on the part of the active members. Unless this be remedied during the forthcoming season the committee will have difficulty in keeping the club together. The most succts>ful competitors were Messrs W. F. Bennett (three wins), P S. K. Macassey (two wins), J. Maxwell, an-1 J. M. Shearer. The Mile Championship of Otago wa3 aided to the programme for the first time, the committee hopiug that it might be the means of inducing outside talent to come forward, but the event was not particularly succefsful. Mr W. F. Bennett was the winner. Afternoon tea was again provided find dispensed by lady friends, and greatly appreciated. At the conclusion of the sports the prizes were pres-nted to the successful competitors by Miss Grierson, each winner being heartily applauded on stepping forward. Your committee take this opportunity of thanking all those gentlemen who so kindly and ably assisted as officials at the meeting. The annual Championship meeting, under the N.Z.A. A.A, was held this year at Napier, but lack of funds prevented your committee doing anything to send a team. Messrs W A. Low and S. Crawnhaw, however, decided to attend the meeting at their own expense, and thus your club was represented, 'the former wai completely suc cessful, wiuni g both the Qu.xrter-milu and Half mile events in great style, and gaining the standard badge for the latter event. The club has reason to feel justly prdud of po<se«sing a member like Mr Low, and your committee beg to express the hope that his successes may induce his club mates and athletes generally to emulate his example. The club's thanks are due to the Otago Cycling Club. Dunedin Cycliug Club, and Boys' High School for including events on their programmes for members of this club. Messrs N. L. Macbeth and G G Mathfsou were the club's delega'es to the N.ZA.A.A., and fulfilled all their duties satisfactorily, and have earned your best thanks. The club sustained a severe luss through Blr P. J. Ness having to resign the secretaryship, and your committee dosure to place on record the many valuable services he has rendered. Mr Ness was always painstaking and ob'iging, and filled the position with entire credit to the club and to him self. Mr D. Duncan is still hon. haudtcapper, and his generous and valuable services so heartily given at all times are worthy of your highest appreciition. The membership stands much the same as in previous years, but your committee regret having again to draw attention to the difficulty in obtaining subscriptions, aud hope that members will assist the officers of the club in financial matter* with more liberality. The year was begun with a credit balance of £11 Is 6d, aud ends with a credit of only £2 17s, thus showing a loss of £8 4s 6d on the yrar's work. In couclufeion your re iring committee beg to express the hope that their successors may receive more loyal and hearty support from members, for without unanimity and common enthusiasm it i« i<upo>Bible to make a club succdisful, and the Dunedin Atn.iteur Athletic Club should stand second to none in the colony an au athletic body We there'ore appeal to members to exert themselves during the in coming season, and if members will only do this and work together, there is no reason why the championship banner should not come to Dunedin.",0,-3.527831016,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/otago-witness/1895/08/08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
373,1892-05-31,HBH,Hawke's Bay Herald,11,"A PRIEST AND THE CONFESSIONAL,","TnK way In which the prieata of the Roman Catholio Church keep the secrets of the confessional has long been the cause of a certain kind of admiration. Why that churoh instituted the con fessional, and why it maintains it, are not subjects for us to discuss. The broad fact is before us, and it never had |a better exemplification than iv the person of the Abbd Doumoulin, a priest of the archdiocese of Aix, ia Paris. According to the London papers, be was three years ago convicted of the murder of a Madame Blanchard, a wealthy aod benevolent lady. The Abbd was convicted upon purely circumstantial evidenco. The facts were that Madame Blanchard had occasion to call at the presbytery occupied by M. Doumoulin in order to receive from him a sum of £400 which lay in his hands to the credit of a religious society with which the lady was connected. The time was midday. In approaching and returning from the presbytery, Madame Blanchard had to pass through a ruined aud deserted monastery. It was known that the lady saw the priest and received tho money from him, but sbe did not return home that day, Four days after wards her dead body was discovered in one of the cells of the old monastery. The remains boro several stabs of a knife, and there was no money upon the person of the murdored lady, A table knife, stained with human blood, nud a pocket hand kerchief, which had belonged to Mndame Doumoulin, were fonnd in the presbytery. The Abbd was the last person known to bave scon the unfortunate lady alive. Ho was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to transportation for life. He was sent to New Caledonia, and placed among the otber convicts thero. The Abba protested his innocence butadduced no proof, tbongh all the time be knew tbe actual mur derer, and the devilish Ingenuity with which he bad managed to throw sus picion on the priest. The murderer, one Kloser, sexton ot the church, had actually confessed to the Abbd ! Yet -the priest, beoause he gained - the knowledge throngh the confessional, sooner tlian betray a trust he deemed sacred book upon himself the disgrace and tbe punishment. He might have died under the fearful stigma had nob Kloser, unable to bear the remorse, con fessed to the authorities. The investiga tion proved the truth ot Kloser's narrative. In England the priest would have been ""graciously pardoned"" by Her Majesty. But they do these things differently in France. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial --of the AbW, by way of form, when he was acquitted, and after three years' imprisonment he returned to his cure in the diooese of Aix, where he was received by his people with great rejoic ing. One may question the nses of the confessional, and regard the Abbe"" as mis taken, but none oan deny admiration for his Bplendid devotion to his vows, To face death for a friend is deemed a brave action. But this parish priest faced what was, to one in his position 1 , far worse than death, and that not tor a friend, but for a miserable wretch who had closed his HpD by nsing him as Bis father confessor. On the fourth page will be fonnd correspondence, onr Waipawa corres poqdent'e letter, and an article entitled "" An Auckland Romance."" Members of the Napier Operatic Society are reminded that the next rehearsal for bhe opera "" Patience "" will be held this evening ab the Provincial Council Chamber at 8 o'clock. Mr 6.

The match between Havelock and Paki Paki, for the second championship, was played at Havelook on Saturday last. A large number of people were present to witness the game, including several of I bhe fair sex. Paki Paki was in difficulties from the commencement of the game, and seldom reaohed their opponents' twenty five, the result being a win for Havelook by 0 points to nil. The score was com piled as follows:— Tare, W. Joll, and C. Lean, one try eaoh. G. Joll kicked a goal from one of these. Mr A. Dean and Mr H. Catherall acted as umpires for Havelock and Paki Pakl respectively, and Mr Holmes was referee.

The latter appeared and consented to the order, which was made as prayed. Our Hastings correspondent writes nnder yesterday's date:— The subscrip tion portrait of the Mayor was presented to him at the Counoil Chamber this afternoon in tbe presence of a large and representative audience. ' Apologies were read from Councillors Foreman and Mur doch. An illuminated address whioh accompanied the portrait set forth the donors appreciation of the Mayor's ser vices to the borough.

In our report of the case of rowdyism in the streets, which resulted iv John Farrell being fined £1 and costs tor helping to jostle Dennis Murnane and then striklug bim on tbe mouth, it was stated tbat Farrell and bis three com panions started from the Provincial Hotel at a quarter to 12 o'clock on Friday night in the direction of the Recreation Ground. This was perfectly true, but it appears bo have conveyed the idea tbat they started from inside the hotel at tbat hour. As a matter of facb the hotel was closed ab II o'clock. The gang were io the hotel at a quarter to 11 o'clock, to the annoyance of the proprietor, who states that be asked theoi to leave the hotel, as be did not wish for any rowdyism in his place. They left, and went np town after endeavoring to be ""witty"" at the expense of a policeman standing near, the "" wit"" consisting of striking a matoh to look for his nnmber. Their subse quent start from tbe hotel to go in tbe direction of the Recreation Ground waa from the outside of tbe premises. The Rev. Br. Lucas, who is at present conducting a temperance mission iv Christchurch, is a magnificent speoimen physically of a cold-water drinker, He stands some 6ft) 2in high, weighs aboub 16 Btone, is as npright as a soldier, and although nearly 60 years of age, preached three times on Sunday, speaking at Dur ham street for over an boar, and then immediately adjonrned to the Tuam street Hall, where he made a long, witty and vigorous speech to au audience ot nearly 2000. Extraoting gold from seawater sounds very muoh like the famous device for extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, bub Aye learn from an American scientific i'ournal (Sqicnce Si/tings) that a patent taa been taken oub for tbe process, and that sanguine views are held as to its success, It has long been known that sea water contains a certain amount of gold in solution. Some authorities have pnt the proportion ab aboub one grain to bhe ton. It is also said thab there is aboub one eighth of a grain of silver in che same amount of sea water. This, however, the inventor treats as a qmntitt ncgligeable, coutining his attention to the gold. The latter he proposes to precipitate from the solution by electrolysis— something after the fashion of electro-plating, Unr con temporary states that very low electro motive power is needed, and implies that ib sees no reason why tbe process should cot be a commercial, as well as a chemical success. This, however, is a poiut whioh still remains to be seen, I The following appears In the Wairarapa Times :—■"" Oue of the moat Important subjects that will have to be debated next session is tbat of the North Island main trunk railway, To the residents of the Anckiand, Taranaki, and Wellington provinces tbo question ot the routes has become a matter of intense interest. The Ministry are now ominously silent ; no expression of opinion can be elicited from them one way or the other. Are they waiting to see how the oat will jump? Is it a question— as a leading Auckland merchant lately said— of votes ? Anyhow, no matter which way they de cldo-for or against the central route— they are bound to lose votes. Never was Government so harassed with doubts and difficulties. The killing part about this central railway affair is that the Govern ment have lately sent a number of unem ployed np to Huntarvllte to work on the line. Ministers do not mind doing work at tho southern end so long as contracts are not advertised, for that would draw Auckland's attention to what they wer* doing, and the fat wonld be in the fire. Work is in hand on the railway miles . beyond the proposed Makohine Gorge viadnct, . Ministers will nob leb the latter contract,, as, of course, it wonld have to be -advertised for, and thereby attract j attention at Auokland."" This ls from the N.Z.

The schooners boat was at once lannched to investigate the matter, when, to the astonishment of the crew the object disappeared, and shortly afterwards came into view again. ' On the last trip of the Medora from the North Captain Snbritzky reported that he bad sighted the sea serpent on the coast, and he bad to undergo the usual amount of ""chaff"" at the handr-of hia friends, who advised him thab the next; time he fell in with anything ol an extraordinary character to pub soma ""salt"" on its tail and bring it along.

234,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,161,CYCLING.,"NOTES BY DEMOX. — — The roads are daily improving in tiding Surface, and a number of riders indulged in a vpin en Saturday afternoon and Sunday. The general topic of conversation just now is annual meetings and election of office bearers. There is, I hear, likely to be some competition for office in the different clubs, and the merits of certain candidates are under discussion. The annual report of the Ot»go CycliDg Club is given below, and I hope to be in a position to give the Dunedin Cycling Club's reporb next week. The annual general meeting of the Dunedin Cycling Club is fixed for the 17th inst. The following report will be submitted to the members of the Otago Cycling Club at the annual meeting to be held on the 21st intt : — Your committee for the teasonlß94-95 have much pleasure in presenting you with their report for the past season, during which, on account of the series of successes obtained in every department appertaining to the club, they have attained a position unparalleled in the history of any cycling club in New Zealand, and in all probability that of any cycling club in Australasia. Everything the club took in hand turned out an unqualified Buccess— financially and otherwise. Last year the club started with a balance of £11 5s and a membership of 73 ; this year we close with the substantial balance of £37 Us 2d, and a totil membership of 327- The maguitude of the club's success will appear much greater than the large balance show 3 when we consider the fact that during the previous season we had no expense in the matter of rent for a club room, but this year, your committee, on account of the increased membership, deemed it advisablt t» procure a central and commodious room, thus in^ -volving a regular expenditure of 10s per week foi lent, besides incidental expenses re extra furnish ing, painting, gas, firing, and cleaning. The com mittee, taking into consideration the stronj financial position of the club, decided ie th« ttiddlo of the season to remit the aubscriptioa of members who joined during the latter part of the year. Your committee thought it advisable for the sake of cycling in generaf to have the opening run of the season held in conjunction with the D. CO., the turn-out totalling 90. The handsome photo, graph now in the club room is a fitting record of the success that attended the initiation of the sea son The usual fortnightly official club runs were held, and were always well attended, considering the fact that a great number of our members can not get away on Saturdays. All the other club runs were well attended, the favourite resorts being Henley, Outram, Mosgiel, North Taieri, Palmerston, aud Waitati. The club have to thank our worthy president, A. Thomson, Esq , for his open invitation to the most interesting spot in tne Taieri— the mineral springs. One good feature about your club is the number of lovers of touring there are among you. Mr M'Phee made trips to Invercargill, the Lakes (via Goldfields and Waimea Plains), Kaitangftta, Clutha, and Lawrence. Mr Albert Thomson rode to ChrUtchurch and back. Messrs JayandE. Law son did the Invercargill trip, while Mr A. Dey rode to Gore and back. Messrs Home and Clarke made a tour to the goldfields via the Waihemo Valley during very wet weather without any mis haps or great discomfiture ; Mr Hart to Roxburgh. Mr Begg (captaiu) rode to Timaru and back, and the comparatively short trips to LawreHce, Milton, and Kaitangata were frequently made by many other members. Your committee believe that much more can bo dove in this direction, as nothing proves the value of cycling so much aa touring, and it is also a means of creating that good fellowship which should exist between the members of every club. As regards the good effects physically, morally, and educationally, touring is one of the greatest factors in making the world seem a better place. We wish thoroughly to impreES these facts upon the incom ing committee as a suggestion for the new sea son. In regard to the road record, your committee can make the proud assertion that the club stands chief in this respect in Otago. Mr M'Kenzie comes first with his Dunediu-Outram record— 49Jmin, March ""30, 1895 ; Dunedin-Henley record, lhr 3min 20aec, April 10, 1895. Mr W. Begg holds the Oamaru-Dunedin record, covering tin distance In6hr lmin. on Aptil 19,1895. These records have been ofl&sially recognised by the N.Z.C.A., Chrisfr cburcb, During the year the increased memberohip de manded more commodius quartets, and the com mittee, after due deliberation, induced by the growing demands of the club, decided to find a larger and more central room, compatible at the same time with the spending power of the club. Many places were inspected, and it was found that the toom in the topmost flat of Ross's Buildings, Octagon, was the most suitable, being sufficiently central and having at the s*me time fair accom modation for machines. The rent (10s per week, with a monthly tenancy) was a reasonable one, and the room was taken, and without doubt, from the way it has been patronised, it has been proved that the selection of thecommittee was a wise one. However, the increasing popularity of the club rendered it necessary to find a still more com modious club room, and it was decided to take the room known as the Otago Art Academy, and which is now occupied by the club. It is now con ceded on every haud that the Otago Club is the proud possessor of a room suitable in every way to their requirements. Before closing the remarks under this heading, we must again express our great indebtedness to Mr S. R. fctedruan for his uniform generosity and courtesy in the matter of providing free accommodation for the members in, the earlier part of the season. The larger accommodation of course demanded increase of outlay upon furniture, and a considerable addition was made to the f«w articles originally belonging to the club. The comm ittee think the time h»3 now arrived when the club sh yjd take over the piano, in accor dance with the agreement made during the earlier stages of the club's existence. The members of the club are deeply indebted to the generosity of the gentlemen comprising the syndicate, who have left to the use of the members an instru ment which has contributed not a little to their enjoy meat during the long winter evenings. Your committee thought it advisable to hold ""musical evening*,"" or ""smoke concerts,"" and ""social dances"" alternately every fortnight, and Messrs Osborne, Muir, aud Munden were appointed a sub-committee and entrusted with the carrying out of the arrangements. The popu larity of these functions attested to the fact that there was a necessity for the enterprise, and, needless to say, the want was well satisfied It was furthermore proved beyond doubt that your com mittee were well justified in the selection of the above-named gentlemen. The musical functions were carried out in the c.lubroom, while the socials were held in St. Paul's Schoolroom, Stuart street. The attendance at these gatherings showed very plainly that the means taken were the best possible schemes for keeping the mem bers together during the winter evenings. From a financial point of view these institutions were also very satisfactory. On December 29, 1804, the club's annual race meeting was held on the Caledonian Society's grounds, and the meeting proved an unqualified success both as regards a financial and a racing point of view. Representatives from all parts of New Zealand competed, the chief viritlng com petitors being Messrs Pither, Simpson, Hall, Hey ward, and Reynolds. Id the evening the visitors were entertained by the club at a smoke concert held in Watson's Hotel. A remarkable feature of the club's history has been its success on the racing path this season, the club being placed no less than 64 limes at the different race meetings open to all clubs. Ihe Otago Club secured no fewer than 25 firsts, 15 seconds, and 24 thirds, which is claimed as a record for Otago. The principal prize-takers were Messrs Barclay, Home, Gibson, Cameron, Clarke, and Ti&dale Several club races were held during the season in the evenings. The out-going committee would strongly urge their successors to continue this laucLble practice, as it tends in no little measure to bring forward the racing talent of the club. The first interptovincial teoru race in New Zealand was held at Invercargill, between repre sentatives from the Invercargill Cycling Club (1.C.C.) and the Otago Cycling Club (O.C.a). The result was a signal victory for the O.C.C. The following represented the club, and worthily up held its prestige :— Mr W. Begg (captain), Messrs M'Kenzie, Gibson, Clarke, Cameron, and Maw. To Mr T. Maw fell the much coveted prize allotted to the first man in the race— a handsome gold medal, of which the recipient and the club generally are justly proud. The thanks of the club are also due to Messrs Osborne, Munden, Morgan, and Lawson for their help, whjch was responsible in no small degree in assisting our team to secure the laurels for Otago. The com mittee also wish to place on record their apprecia tion of the kindly treatment of their team at the hands of the 1.C.0. While speaking of team races it may not be out of place to mention that the committee regret the D.C.C. were unable to raise a team to meet us during the earlier part of the season. The club were successful in securing the first and third prizes in connection with the first road race, Dunedin-Henley, held under the auspices of the D.C.C. In the Outram Road Race, March 16, 1895, open to all clubs, the 0.0.C. secured first, second, and third places. The prize-takers were Messrs Wright and M Thee in the Henley Road Race, and Messrs Barclay, M'Kenzie, and Morgan in the Outram Road Race. One of the most regrettable incidents during the year was the resignation of Mr E. Howlison aa treasurer of the club, owing to the demands upon his time ; and also the resignation (owing to removal) of Mr H. Inglis. Both these gentlemen had been connected with the clubs initiation, and with unceasing energy were to a great extent Instrumental in piloting it through its earliest stages, and your committee feel that the present success of the club is largely due to the unflagging interest these gentlemen threw into their work when the club was in its infancy. It was deemed a fitting tribute to the past services of these gentlemen to elect them life members of the club, and accord ingly at a general meeting this proposal was carried with acclamation. Mr J. Osborne was unanimously elected treasurer in Mr Howlison's place. The club thanka the Caledonian Society for the free use of their ground for the club races, tin donors of prizes, the geutlemen who so kindly assisted at the race meeting, Messrs Milner and Mussen (the club's delegates on the N.Z.C.A.), and last, but not least, the press, who gave such publicity to the club's affahs. In conclusion, your committee hope that the affairs of the club will ever be in as satisfactory a condition as the close of the present season finds them. At the monthly committee meeting of the Dunedin Cycling Club, held in the club room on Wednesday evening, it was decided to hold the annual meeting on Saturday, August 17, at 8 p.m. A deputation was appointed to wait on the seoretary of the Carisbrook Ground Company to see if the company was prepared to do anything in the way of improving the tr»ck for the coming season. It was decided to challenge the Otago Cycling Club to a friendly game of euchre, 12 players a-side, to be plajed on Wednesday evening, 7th in*t. The club is at present occupying the room formerly uted by the Chess Club in the Occi dental buildings until their own rooms are thoroughly renovated. A meeting of the recently-formed ladies' cycling club was held at Miss iStatham's rooms on Saturday evening. There were present Mesdames Brent (in the chair), Scott, Lewis, and H'ggins, Misses Dale, Maxwell (2), Rigg, Betnett, and Btatham. Five new members were elected, and it was decided to name the club the Mimiro Cycling Club. The club mem bership now stands at 18 active members, and the club will take part as a body in the formal opening of the season by the Dunedin and Otago Clubs. The members of the Mimiro Cycling Club wereratheramused at a letterread at their recent meeting. The secretary of the Labour Day sports meeting wrote asking if the members of the club would compete in a bicycle race at the sports meeting to be held on October 9. The ladies were decidedly nob favourable to com peting in a cycle race, and it was decided to send a reply to that effect. It is a little sur pruing that such a letter should be sent to the club. CycliDg among ladies as a means to the pleasant enjoyment of a few hours in the conn try and as a recreation has always bad my strong support and has been universally upheld, but racing amoDg the fair sex has received lib tie or no support at the hands of the ladies, and is strongly discouraged by all true lovers of the sport. Therefore the letter from the Labour Day organisation, though no doubt written in kindly feeling, is sarpriiing, and excites some comment. The word ""mimiro,"" adopted as the name pf the ladies' cycling club, is a Maori one, and its meaning is ""to move swiftly."" The name is a very suitable one, illustrating tho swift movement of the bicycle through space, and I wish the members of the club a prosperity that will "" more swiftly"" and place them on a firm footing, and a thorough enjoyment of that swift motion through the air that is one of the huppiest experiences of cycling. I understand that it is the intention of Miss Mitchell, the well-known lady cyclist, of Gore, to make a trip to Invercargill before Christmas on the pnematic skates. The League of New South Wales Wheel men intend to hold a race meeting in November or December, and give £500 in prizes. In August of next year the big meetirjg of the year will beheld, and the prize for one race will be £500. The prize is the biggest ever offered anywhere for a bicycle race, and the league ex pects to have competition from Australasia, America, Great Britain, and the Continent. Advice of this great meeting in August 1896 is bciug sent to all the cycling centres of the world. G. J. Shaffee, "" a novice,"" rode a mile in 2min 19« ec at Syracuse (U.S.) on June 12 John S.

231,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,158,SATURDAY'S MATCHES. THE RUGBY GAME —TRIAL MATCH.,"On the Carit-bioote ground on Saturday after noon* with somewhat peculiar surroundings, the first of the O.R F.U. trial matches for the aeason was played. The hard frosts of the latter part of the week, acting upon the snow which bad fallen in the earlier portion, had frozen hard the white hhroud on the hills over- ' lookii g Carisbrook, and where the ground itf>elf ** was not exposed to fhe influence of tha sun there was an almost unbroken sheet of what tad become ice. Fortunately the playiug field wu almost free from the traces of the snow- fallr-^tbough these extended almost up to the touchline on each side, and the turf was more over wonderfully firm D T aa inter-club match during the seaton has in fact been played under less advantageous circumstances than were offered to the |>'ayers on Saturday. Both the turns chosen by the Match Committee of the Rugby Union were on the firld to a man, tut an injured foot prevented Hobson from pbying. and a place was thus found for W. Wilkinson The match, which was controlled by Mr F H Campbell, was an exceedingly even one, the Blues (who played a man short for the greater part of the second spell, Mason having to retire with a naoty out on his head, caused by ita coming into violent contact with that of another player) wit.niug by 6 points to 3. For the Blues, good passing among the backs enabled Sullivan to score, and a jinking run by Mason was ended by bis crossing the line — both these scores being gained in, the first spell. Williamson and Cran respectively failed with the kicks at goal. In the second *pell M'Farlnne scored for the Colours, and M'Laren had a fruitless shot at goal. The play furnished on the whole a satisfactory exposi tion of the g irne, but there were far too many minor infringements. The practice amocg the forwards of lifting the foot before the ball has been put into the scrum was of frequent occurrence, and will have to be checked, for tha penalty for it is a severe one, and a team whose forwards are in the habit of committing this fault may pay dearly for it. Hnud balling on the line was not so noticeable aa it has been iv club matches, but there was too much passing forward, careless passing, and neglecting to pass. The dribbling on both sides was at times good, and tho tackliDg was on the whole very sound. Tho backs, almost without exception, kicked well, but a few of them played rather 'selfishly, while there was more fumbling than there thould have been. Both fall backs did their work well ; Armit, Cran, Mackenzie, Stepheuson, and Macdonald (who took Sallivan's place in the second spell) were, perhapp, the most conspicuous of the three quarter backs ; there was very little to choose between the half backs ; and M'Farlane, the Torrance brothers, and E^quilaut were the pick of th«j forwards. The MatchtCommittee have selected the fol lowing teams for next Saturday's trial match : — Blues.— Full back — Ross ; three - quarters- Mackenzie, Cunningham, Stephenson ; halves — Mason. Duncan, Cran ; forwards— Bailantyne, M'Farlane, J. Torrance, Given, Priest, Beadle, Lowry, H. Wilkinson. Colouiis — Full back — King; three-quarters— Macdonald, Maca«sey, Armit ; halves Davis, Fordj cc, Thomson ; forwards— D. Torrance, EsquiUnt, W. Wilkinson, M'Laren, Hobson, Toothill, Campbell, King, Martin; reserves- Harris, Restieaux, Malcolm, Stewart. /Junior Flag, taieri v. green island. The above match was plajed at Mosgiel on Saturday before a large number of spectators. The Taieri Club hud used scoops to clean the ground from snow, but only about half of the ground was cleared, and this put any good paß«iog play out of the question. The Green Island kicked off and soon had the ball in the Taien's twentj-five, where it remained for some time, until the Greeus were awarded a free kick, and Davidson narrowly missed placing a goal The Greens had two more attempts at goal from free kicks, but nothing re salted — the ball not rising any distance. For the rest of the first spell the play was fairly even — the Greena having slightly the best of it. The Taieri Kcked off, and, the baU beiog well returned by E Kerr, play remained in the Taieri's twenty five mO'.t of the time ; but the Gieens were uuable to score, although they were vit,hin a few yards of the Taieri's line A few miautes before time J. Fljno was ordered off the field by the referee for striking one of the Green Island players. The whistle sounded with the ball within (he Taieri quarters. For tha Taieri, Mann, and M 'Donald (backs) and Bringans and Johnnton (forwards) played beat, as did Kerr (2), Davidson (2, bscka), Canning, Irvine, Kerr, and Wilkinson (forwards) for Green Islaud. Mr MConuocbie was a most impartial referee, his decisions giving satisfac tion to both teams. Result : — Green Island ... Nil Taieri Nil UNIVERSITY SECOND V. H/GH SCHOOL. This match was played at Tahnna Park under the control of Mr Austin, who gay*- every satisfac tion. In the ikst spell fcho 'Varsity played against the wind, but tries were secured for them by Melville and Sale. In the second spell the 'Varsity expected to add materially to their score, but only two more tries were ob tained by Orkney and Steadman, from oae of which Gibson placed a goal. A few minutes before time Fisher scared a try for the School, froai which a goal was kicked, and the game ended. University... Ji points High School... s points MELROSE V. DUNEDIN SECOND.

For the lo»ers Driver, Connor, Morris, and Davis plajed well. Mr Falconer gave every satisfaction with the whistle. Result : — Melrose ... 44 points Dunedin Ml PIRATES SECOND V. PACIFIC. This match was played at Tahuna. Park and produced a close contest. The Pirates acted on the defensive for tbe greater p»rt ot the first spell, but; in the second spell Gregg scored a try for them, which was not improved. This was the only score. Complaints were mede that the absence of marked touch lines on the ground caused a good deal of confusion. Result :— Pirates ... 3 points Pacific Nil ZINGARI-RICHMOND SECOND V. CAVEBSHAM SECOND. The match between these teams was played at Monteoillo, and resulted in a win for the former, for whom Henney ecored a try, whi«h he converted. For the Caveraham Rowl«y jcored a try, but the kick at goal was a failure. For the winners Austin and Wintrop (backs) and Smith, Lane, R.

For the Star Bennett, Wyllie, Eyre, and Logan, and for the Warehousemen Colletfc, Hutchinson', M'Downll, and Driscoll played well. The return match between United and Albion resulted in a win for the United by 11- paints to 4- points. Tries were obtained for the United by M. Driscoll (2) and J. M'Farlana. W. Gibba converted one. For the Albion Stewart kicked a goj.l from a mark. The White Star visited Ravensbourne to meet the Ravensbourne Second, and suffered defeat by 11 points to 6. Thb Association Game, koslyn v. Rangers Thia match, which was played on the Exhibi tion ground, attracted a large and enthusiastic a '-tendance, the number beiog largely iudeistd by the fact that owing lo various causes oaly one other Association game was payed on Saturday. Bv>bh teams were confident of their ability to win, and as eaoh had hitherto ra«n tained an unbroken reri? s of successes, a close coote&t was anticipated. Those who attended were in no wise disappointed in this reapt-ct, the gamo being fa--t and exciting throughout, and notwithstanding minor faults on both sides the contest undoubtedly provided a splendid expo sition of Association football. From the kick off the Roslyn forwards rushed the ball into dangerous proximity to the Rangers' goal, but O'Connor, with a rather fluky kick, relieved the pressure, and the Rangers' forwards scouring the ball they in their turn transferred the scene of operations to the other end of the field. Judicious kicking by Q. M'MWlan (who was playing a splendid g*me) aud Hajward soon afterwards placed the Blues once more in pos session of the leather, aud they, by excolleut dribbling and passing, invaded the Blacks' territory, where Bunting succeeded in scoring. The Rangers, nothing daunted by this reverse, continued to play up pluckily, aud were soon rewarded, as from a miekick by D M'Millan, Sligo got away with a passing iu*h, at the end of which he. succeeded in equalis ing the scores. Half time was soon afterwards called with the ball in the Rangers' quarters/ Pvoslyn so far having had slightly the best of the game. The play in the second spall showed a marked improvement in respect to accuracy in passing and kicking, aud was if anything faster than previou|ly. Bach side attacking in turn, the backs of both teams had a large amount of work to perform, Kober, Ash*, on, and A. North for the Rangers, and G. M'Millan, Calder, and Hayward for the R's'yo being especially noticeable. The forward play was in favour of Ro*lyo, and from one of several fa«t passing rashes the Blues again succeeded in scoring, Dobson being responsible for the ad vantage thas gained. For some time after tbi* it scarcely seemed as if any further additions to the score were likely. Harrop, Peters, aud Sligo were, however, playing with gre*t deter mination, and mainly through the efforts of the two first-named Sligo again gain got the ball when near the Rdlyu goal and took a smart shot, the referee's whistle announcing th*t the scores were once more even, thnu^h to many it seemed that Ellis hid juati managed to prbvtmt tha score. The Roslyn continued to press the it opponents, bub Kober by fisting out averted what seemed to be certain scores, his play at thia juncture securing well merited applause. O'Connor and Ashton, who were also playing splendidly, staved of attack after attack, and the game eventually ended in a draw.

291,1895-08-08,OW,Otago Witness,218,TABLE TALK.,"Monday, August 5. The Kahanga (Ladies' Savage) Club held its weekly meeting last Monday at The Chalet, the residence of Mrs Henry Macken zie. Mrs Woodhouse was chairwoman for the evening, and had procured some excel lent items for the evening's amusement. The programme also, which was most artistic, had been painted by Mrs Woodhouee. The weather was about as bad as it could pos sibly be, enow lying thick on the ground and a cold howling wind with driving showers of hail alternating every few minutes. Con sequently the attendance was not nearly so good as is usual at these most enjoyable meetings, ""^bout 30 ladies were present, amongst, whom were, besides Mrs Macken zie. Miss Dent, Mrs Woodhouee, the Misses Rattray, Miss Greenwood, Miss R. Neill, Miss Kenyon, the Misses MacLaren, the Misses Roberts, the Misses Raynoldp, the Misses Whitney (Auckland), the Misses Graham, Mrs Denniston, Miss Ulricb, Miss Gilkieon, Mrs Sale, and the Misses Webster. One of the best items on the first part of the programme was an excellent recitation from Misß May Kenyon, which was followed by "" Funiculi funicula,"" sung capitally by Miss L. Roberts, who was accompanied by Miss Roberts at the piano an,d by Miss Batch elor (in a most picturesque Spanish peasant's dress) on the mandolin, while Miss E. MacLaren and Miss S. Graham formed a chorus. After refreshments, which were served in tho laige dining room, and were much appreciated by all present, a very clever dialogue was given by Miss Fanny Rattray and Miss R. Neill. This evoked a perfect round of applause, and the' performers received much praise from their audience. ,Miss E. MacLaren brought the evening's amusement to a close by siDging a very pretty little Italian song in a most pleasing manner. The next meet ing of the club will be at the residence of Mrs Ogston, in High street, when Mies Webster and Mies Maud Sise will be chair women. On Wednesday afternoon Mrs A. A. Finch gave an afternoon tea in honour of Miss Robinson, who, with her parents, has lately come from Hobart to reside in Dunedin. Uo fortunately the weather, which had cleared np at the end of the former week, was very bad indeed. Thick enow, made hard with the heavy frosts, covered every road and path, while drizzling showers of rain fell at intervals. Not nearly all the expected guests put in an appearance, doubt less owing to the weather, but about 30 were present, and an exceedingly pleasant afternoon was spent. There was music in the drawing room, which was only separated from the dining room by heavy tapestry curtains, and thus the music could be heard distinctly in both rooms, which made it most enjoyable. Miss L. Bhand, Miss Roberts, Miss L. Roberts, Miss A. Greenwood, and Miss S. Graham all sang charm ingly, and Miss Miller delighted her audience with Borne brilliant pianoforte*per formances. Tea and coffee were served in the dining room, and the table was most beautifully decorated, with pgle preeu crinkled paper and tall glasses of delicate green grasses and foliage intermixed with the paper. Amongst the gueßts present were Mrs H. MacNeil, Mrs and Miss Robin boo, Miss Miller, the Misses Greenwood, the Misses Shand, the Mistes Graham, Miss Morris, Miss I. Rattray, the Misses Webster, the Misses Bartleman, Miss Roberts, Miss Buisck, Mies Driver, Miss L. Roberts, Miss L. Mackcrrap, Mies Scott, Miss Haggitt, Miss E. Ulricb, Miss M. Sise, Miss Burnett (Hawk dun), and Mies H. ""Driver. Mrs Finch wore an extremely smart heliotrope crepon blonso trimmed daintily with jet and black chiffon over a black silk skirt; Mrs MacNeil, shot velvet blouse and dark skirt; Miss Miller, black eerge costume with heliotrope, and white shirt front; Miss Robinson, light checked tweed costume with trimmings and sleeveß of grey velvet, large grey hat trimmed elaborately with pink roses ; Miss Haggitt, navy blue skirt and Eton jacket, the latter being faced back with mirror silk, boa and toreador hat ; Mi-s L. Mackerras, a pretty tweed frock with yoke and eleeves of electric blue velvet, large picture hat of black vel vet ; Miss S. Bartleman, long coat of brown cloth, arid felt.hit en suite ; Miss G. Webster, brown cloth costume consisting of skirt and jacket with blue silk vest avid brown-hat. Miss Reynolds on Thursday afternoon in vited a number of girls to afternoon tea to meet the Misses Whitney, who are visiting her at present. After tea, which was beauti fully set out in the dining room, the table being decorated with hothouse plants and yellow crinkled paper, the whole party adjourned to the garden, where the steep terraces induced all present to join in tobogganing — a most pleasant pastime. Sledges, however, were not at band, so trays were used, and proved an excellent substi tute. The terraces at Montecillo seem as though they had been specially formed for this kind of sport, and the young ladies one and all joined in the fun, thus making it one of the most successful teas of the season. Amongst those present, besides Miss Rey nolds and Miss Maud Reynolds, were t c Misses Whitney, Miss Greenwood, Miss Dent, Miss M. Sise, Miss R. Neill, Miss Burnett (Hawkdun), Miss Webster, Miss G. Webster, Miss MacLaren, Miss Farquhar, Miss John stone (Wellington), the Misses Gilkison, Miss P. Gibson, the Misses Rattray, and the Misses Oargill. On Thursday evening Mrs H. Mackenzie gave a most novel and enjoyable "" At home"" at her residence, the Chalet. Between 30 and 40 guests were invited, and a most en joyable time was spent. The entertainment for the evening consisted of, firstly, an amusing sketch, entitled "" The Ticket Office,"" in which the following ladies took part ; — Miss MacLaren, Miss G. Rattray, M ; sa Green wood, Miss I. Rattray, and Miss Hodgklns ; and, secondly, a play, the characters being capitally sustained by the Misses MacLaren and Graham (2). There was also some good music during the evening, songi being sung by Miss I. Graham and Mr O. Rattray, .and a pianoforte selection was given by Miss G. Roberts. Amongst those present, besides Mrs Mackenzie, were the Misses MacLaren, Mr and Mrs J. Wright, Miss -Miss Dent, Mr and Miss {Sine, Miss Robert*, Mr Pasco, Mr and Miss Rattray, Mies Neill, Mr and M*g< Webster, Mr and Mips Hodgkina, Mr and the Misses Graham, Mr and Miss Reynolds, Miss Whitney, Mr Wright, and Mr Sievwright. Mrs Mackenzie wore a oharmiDg gown of black eilk relieved with heliotrope ; Mrs J. Wright wore black ; Miss MacLaroD, white, and her sister an elegant combination of blue silk and black lace ; Miss Graham, a pretty blue silk blouse with pearl trimming; Mies Greenwood, a gown of bright blue silk ; Miss Reynolds, terra cotta velvet and cream lace ; Miss Whitney, red silk blouse with wide lace at the neck ; Miss Roberts, green velvet with lace trimmings ; Mists G. Rittray, cream silk and lace ; Miss Dent, a charming robe of heliotrope silk trimmed with velvet of a darker shade; Miss Neil], heliotrope bro cade. On Friday evening Mrs J. M. Ritchie gave a most enjoyable ""At home"" at her resi dence, Balvraid, in honour of Mr and Mrs Tescbemaker, who are paying her a visit at present, from Canterbury. Mrs Ritchie had at first invited her guests for Tuesday even ing, but owing to the very perturbed state of the elements on that night, she kindly post poned her party until Friday, so as to save her guests the necessity of coming out in the enow, the sleet, and the rain. Con trary to the words of the old proverb, the hostess's thoughtfulnees was amply repaid, one and all spending a moat happy evening. About 60 guests were present, and the first part of the evening was taken up by playing progressive euohre in the large drawing room, where about a dozen small tables were prepared for this ever-popular game, while the remainder of the guests amused them selves by playing other games in the morning room. After each game the winners had ribbons allotted to them, and at the conclu sion of about half a dozen games the lady who had secured the greatest number of ribbons was Miss Reynolds, and the gentle man Mr Charlie Morris. Both of these were presented with very tasteful prizes by the hostess, Miss Reynolds receiving a most chaste cut-crystal smellirjg-salts bottle and Mr Morris an oxidised silver table-napkin ring; while Miss Rattray and Mr D'Arcy Haggitt, who had won the fewest number of games, were the recipients of a dainty cup and saucer and silver match box respectively. Supper was served iv the long dining room, and the table looked lovely. When an adjournment was made to the drawing room again, seats were all arranged in the body of the room, and the large bay window was cut off by curtains. These were soon raised, and then followed an excellent representation of ""A Row in the Pit,"" the leading characters being taken by Mesdames Napier Bell and Sale and the Misses Hodgkins, Webster, MacLaren, and others. This was very much appreciated by all, and as the jangling tunes arose from the piano and the hoarse cries from the pit, it seemed exactly to resemble sitting at the pantomime, waiting for the curtain to rise.

It was in terebting to learn that Miss B. MaoLaren's frock was her own grandmother's wedding gown. They all repeated their words per fectly, and were beard distinctly through the whole room.
