13,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,14,ENGLAND'S STAKE IN THE ITALIAN OUESTION.,"[From the Morning Post.""] Could the persons who even for a moment dreamed Of supporting Lord Elcho's motion, could they really be aware of the commercial interests which England has at stake in the Italian question, and of the de gree in which those interests would be affected by the constitution of an Italian confederation 1 Should the provisions of the treaty of Villafranca be carried out in the direct and modified form in which they are at present known to us, we shall speedily witness the interruption of all commerce with a great popu lation of 26,000,000, which, if left to the unfettered exercise of the national will, to the adoption of na tional opinions, and to the securing of national in terests in commercial policy, would be our best cus tomers in Europe. With Austrian influence para mount in Italy — with an Austrian policy forced on, and adopted by the federal diet — Italy would soon exhibit a southern customs' league as closely barred against English products as the commercial confe deration in the north. Not Sardinia alone, the whole of Italy as well will be absorbed in the Aus trian' commercial system, if Austria be enabled to dictate, through governments nominally independent but virtually subject to her control, the commercial relations of the different Italian states. Indeed, matters far from having improved, will be far worse than they were before. Austria, which in 1852, at tempted to extend the customs' league to the utter most point of Tuscany, by seeking to include within its bounds the three duchies, was then foiled in the attempt, chiefly through the energy of Sir Henry Bulwer, and was compelled to remain satisfied with the sole addition of Parma and Modena. Even that league was broken up by the firm and patriotic con duct of the sovereign of Parma, and Austria was, in consequence, compelled to enter into a separate treaty (in direct violation, as Count Cavour proved, of previous engagements) with the Duchy of Mode na. The resistance of Tuscany to every attempt on the pait of Austria to obtain the abandonment of the enlightened system of commercial liberty long re cognised as a fundamental piinciple of the state has been continuous and hitherto successful. But all this will avail nothing if, by the provisions of the treaty of Villafranca, unmodified, almost unnoticed by England, a power shall bo vested in Austria of dictating; through her Roman, Neapolitan, Moden ese, and Tuscan representatives, as well as enforcing by her own direct influence at the Roman diet, the whole relations of Italian trade with the other Euro pean states. We suspect that before the lapse of many months a considerable change would be per ceptible in the tone of some very worthy members, when they found as the practical result of their non intervention theories, a great falling-offin their ba lance-sheets, which have hitherto borne testimony to very substantial profits in the Italian markets. We are almost malicious enough to wish that a slight pecuniary martyrdom might enable these worthy poisons to exhibit their perfect readiness to suffer for their faith, and to adorn by the heroism of self sacrifice their peculiar doctrines on foreign policy.",0.0,0.011508684355096265,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

4,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,5,UNTITLED,"By the last English mail we received the first number of The Old Folks at Home, a journal established evidently with the view of promoting extended commercial relations between the New Zealand colonists and the port of Liverpool. The title, the judicious admonition conveyed in the motto, and the kindly tone of the introductory article of this little "" Messenger of love "" cannot fail to gratify all, and will be appreciated by most of our readers, few of whom can, un moved, think of the dear old Jolh in the dear old country. Most earnestly do we desire that the kindly feeling which at pre sent exists between the noble parent state and her vigorous offspring may be fostered and never diminish, so that when in the natural course of events parental contiolis removed, reciprocal affection may subsist unimpaired. If, in some future age, the New Zealander (spoken of by Lord Macaulay), shall stand on a broken arch of London bridge and contemplate the ruins of St. Paul's, we trust that it will be rather with the feel ings of an affectionate child grieving over the cherished remains of a departed parent, than with the mere pride of a descendant of the most powerful nation recorded in his tory, musing on its mighty power and imperishable glory, and mourning over its departed grandeur. Those parties in the mother country (for we cannot consider them statesmen) who desire to sever the tie between Great Bri tain and her Anglo-Saxon colonies on the plea of their enormous cost to the mother country, would do well to consider if the annual expense entailed is not more than counterbalanced by the vast outlet they afford to the pauper population of Great Britain, which would otherwise be main tained by the poor rates, but which emi grates at the cost of those colonies, with its home habits and wants, the former too con firmed to be ever abandoned, and the latter, so thoroughly inbred as to preclude the substitution even of a superior foreign ar ticle, for the home manufacture which long use has rendered indispensable. Thou sands who would otherwise have been paupers at home, have emigrated to the Australian Colonies, and New Zealand, to aid in the production of staple commodities for the manufacturing of which, England has been famed from time immemorial, to develop the mineral resources of their adopted country, and to become large and profitable purchasers of British manufac tures. Their exports of Gold, Wool, Flax, and Tallow, and we trust soon be able to add Cotton, must materially contribute to the wealth of the parent state. To the Old Folks at Home, we say God bless you !

12,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,13,"NATIVE LAND CLAIMS.  [From the Otago Colonist, October 7.]","We observe that Mr Commissioner Cutten is to hold a Court on Monday next, for the investigation of certain land claims, and that one applicant claims one million and forty thousand acres in this Province, and twenty thousand acres in Stewart's Island. ""We do not know how far the decision of Mr Commissioner Cutten may go to to es tablish or enforce the right of such claim ants to a Crown grant, or -whether or not his decision is practically final ; be this as it may, we must say that Mr Cutten is the last man to whose judgment the adjudica tion of such vast interests ought to be en trusted, assuming that the Crown is to apt upon that judgment. There are parties in existence who have ostensible claims to millions of acres of land throughout this Province, which they allege were purchased by them from the natives long before Bri tish authority was established in these is lands ; if these claims are now to be recog nised to their full extent, it will be a very serious matter for this Province, and will considerably impair the public estate, from the disposal of which we anticipate so much in the way of immigration and public works. We do not know whether or not the Pro vincial Government appears at these so called courts of investigation of Mr Com missioner Cutten ; but if not, it is certainly their bounden duty to see that the public interests are in no way prejudiced, by be ing left in the hands of a Commissioner in whom no great confidence can be placed where either his own interests or prejudices may be involved. We must not be understood as prejudg ing the cases of land claimants, or as as serting that there is no just foundation fpr their claims. We believe, that in some in stances, and to some extent, equitable claims may be made out, but with respect to the great bulk of such claims, we are in clined to think they rest on no good foun dation . Many of them have been foreclosed long ago, simply because the parties did not deem it worth their while to appear be fore any of the Commissioners who from time to time were appointed to investigate them ; and the probability is, that it is on ly the value which the lands of the Pro vince have acquired from settlement, that has drawn many of those claims out from the oblivion to which their owners had consigned them. We understand that many of them cover lands which were pur chased from the natives by Mr Maritell ; and we know that the last purchase effected by that gentleman, payment for which was made out of the funds of the Province, and for which a regular deed was executed by the sellers, included lands now claimed, in virtue of alleged transactions with the na tives twenty years ago. We again repeat, that it behoves the Provincial Government to see to it at once that no individual, be he who he may, shall be permitted to decide authoritatively in this matter.",0.0,0.00019863088428676703,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

2,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,3,"The Taranaki Herald.  NEW PLYMOUTH, NOVEMBER 5, 1859.","The near approach of another session of the General Assembly renders it necessary that some steps should be taken to secuie to this province the full extent of repre sentation to which it is entitled. The pro vince is divided into the electoral districts of the Town, the Giey and Bell, and the Omata, which are respectively supposed to be represented ; but practically Taranaki only retains the services of one member — Mr C. W. Richmond's position as a mem ber of His Excellency's government has practically divested that gentleman of lo • cal inteiest, whilst Mr East some time since quitted the colony under circumstances which reasonably preclude his return. Our observations are, however, principally di rected to Mr East, on whom we have no desire to waste words. We might con clude from that person's antecedents that he would leave his Omata constituency in the lurch ; as he has done so it behoves them to enquire if there be any mode for securing a representation in tlie forthcom ing parliament of the colony. The Constitution Act provides that it shall be lawful for any member of the House of Representatives to resign into the hands of the Speaker the trust committed to him. That Mr East did not do this, need surprise no one. The same Act de clares that a scat in the House shall, in certain cases, become vacant, as for in stance, if a member shall for one whole session without the permission of the House fail to give his attendance, or shall become bankrupt or an insolvent debtor within the laws relating to insolvent debtors, or shall become a public defaulter, but we believe that Mr East's financial embarrassments, though morally disqualifying him from a seat in the House, could not be brought under this clause of the Act. The hope for the Omata electors is in the Act passed last session by the General Assembly for supplying vacancies in the House of Representatives during the recess. It provides that whenever it shall be esta blished to the satisfaction of the Speaker that the seat of any member of the House has become vacant by death, resignation, or otherwise, the Speaker shall address the Governor stating the existence of such va cancy, and the cause thereof, and the Gov ernor shall forthwith cause a writ to be is sued for supplying such vacancy. It is further provided that if when any such va cancy shall occur or exist, the Speaker be absent from the colony, a Committee to consist of the persons described in the Act may act in lieu of the Speaker. Here then, we believe, the electors have the remedy in their hands. Let them lose no time there fore in laying before the Speaker the cir cumstances, so far as they are known, which impelled Mr East to quit Taranaki, and subsequently Nelson where he held an ap pointment in the Customs, we feel assured grounds can be shewn to satisfy the Speaker that a vacancy really exists in the repre sentation of the district. The Act of As sembly was designed to remove an incon venient requirement of the Constitution Act, the duty of addressing the Governor on the existence of a vacancy devolving upon the House. This, as we have seen, may now be done by the Speaker during the recess, and, in his absence, by a Com- I mittee of Members of the House. The in tention of the Assembly was clearly to pro vide against a seat remaining vacant from any cause, thereby depriving the district of representation for a period. The electors of Omata owe it to themselves not to sub mit to he the dupes of Mr East's neglect and indifference ; and they have yet a higher duty to discharge — to put an end to the mockery and sham of any man who may have gained admission to the House, being still considered to represent a con stituency when all the circumstances, as in the present instance, are against any such assumption.",0.0,6.102680574848736e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

17,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,18,THE CAUSE OF RAIN.,"[From the Saturday Review.'} An Essay on the Cause of Rain and its allied Phenomena. By G. A. Roweli, Honorary Member of the Ashmolean Society. Oxford: published by the Author. .1859. Ir there is any country in the world where a more than ordinary interest in the theory of the weather, and especially in the cause of rain, ought to be felt, damp, drizzly, changeable, foggy England is surely the place. To judge from the inevitable ten dency of English small talk to fasten upon insignificant meteorological facts as the most appropriate basis of conversation, there really seems to be a sufficiently eager •desire to fathom the mysteries of the wea ther. The same disposition shows itself in a thousand ways. A weather almanac which makes one happy prediction becomes a fortune to the lucky publisher. Penny a-liners surpass themselves when they have portentous thunderbolts and monstrous hailstones to write about : and as the ste reotyped accounts of the progress of the electric fluid, and the amazement of the olclest inhabitant invariably appear in the daily papers, however great may be the supply of more important news, it may be presumed that the subject is one which may always be relied on to win a host of readers. Then there are thousands of peo ple who have their own infallible methods of foretelling a change of weather by the changes of the moon, or by the more sci entific plan of a cycle of observations. The number of observers who note, with greater or less accuracy, the variations of the barometer and thermometer, and mea sure every inch of rain that falls through out the year, is almost countless. Perhaps there is no scientific subject which receives so much attention of every kind, from the most philosophical down to the most casual observations, as meteorology, and especi ally that branch of the science which treats of the phenomena connected with rain. And yet nothing, or almost nothing, is known with certainty about this univers ally studied science. The nearest approach to an explanation of the cause of rain which is to be found in any standard scientific work is sure to be a slipshod sort of theory which rather indicates a more or less con ceivable cause than affects to give a sound induction from the multitude of observed phenomena. The field has long been open for discovery, and Mr Rowell has come forward with a theory which he believes sufficient to solve"" the whole mystery of rain and snow, wind and hail, lightning and tempest, which has baffled the world till now. Nay, he even goes so far as to sug gest a scheme by which rain may be pro duced at pleasure, and holds out some hope of satisfying the agricultural desire for rain upon the green crops and sun upon the hay. We gather from Mr Rowell's 'introductory chapter, and from some casual remarks in ,the course of the work, that he is a self educated paper-hanger, over whose mind the phenomena of meteorology have exer cised a marvellous fascination. To fathom the cause of rain and its attendant pheno mena became a passion with him, and the present work is the ripe fruit of his inves tigation, whicli had already been given to ' the world in a pamphlet, published in 1841, with the startling title, "" Conjectures on the Cause of Rain, Storms, the Aurora, and Magnetism : with a Suggestion for Causing Rain at Will."" Probably the readers first impulse will be to laugh at so preposterous a pretension, and to class the author among the crowd of demented discoverers who are always producing infallible methods of squaring the circle and new inventions for perpetual motion. There could not be a greater mistake. Whatever may be the amount of truth in his theory, Mr Rowell is not a man to be laughed at. Like Hugh Miller, he was born with the true scientific instinct ; and though he very needlessly deprecates criticism of his style and argu ments, and modestly recounts the draw backs of his career, the clearness with which his theory is explained, and the logical force with which the argument from record ed and familiar facts is maintained, could not have been surpassed if scientific com position had been the only occupation of the author's life, In saying this, we do not mean to convey the impression that we are prepared to accept Mr Rowell's theory. If it were material to give a precise opinion upon it, we should be disposed to class it among the preliminary theories which in every branch of science have led through error into truth. The Ptolemaic system of astronomy was physically false, but it grouped together a vast number of true facts, and was really the first step towards the Copernican system, which at the first blush seems to be in diametrical opposition to it. Just in the same way, Newton's false corpuscular theory of light generalised a vast number of facts, and offered expla nations of the phenomena of diffraction which were capable of being transferred al most unchanged into the undulatory theory of Young. Our author will probably be found to occupy a corresponding position in the science of meteorology. By means of a simple theory he has generalised a vast number of phenomena ; and though we believe his fundamental hypothesis to be altogether inadmissible, it may not impro bably prove the first step towards the true theory, from which any future advance will be made by incorporating, as it were en masse, the fruits of Mr Rowell's hypo thesis. But it is time that we should state what the hypothesis is. It constitutes (with abundant probability) electricity as the prime agent in all atmospheric phenomena. It assumes that electricity is a material fluid, occupying a sensible portion of space to the exclusion of air or other matter, though not ponderable or at least not ap preciably so. This fluid is supposed to diffuse itself over the surfaces of all mate rial bodies with a tendency to equal dis tribution. Any substance surcharged with more than its natural or equilibrium pro portion of electricity is positively electri trified, and when supplied with a thinner coating than naturally belongs to it, >,be comes negatively electrified. The rest we give in the author's own words : — The theory is, that the atoms of water being so minute are, when completely enveloped in their na. tural coatings of electricity, rendered so buoyant as to be liable, even when in their most condensed state, to be carried off by slight currents of air j but if expanded by heat, their capacity for electricity being increased by their increase of surface, they are then rendered buoyant at all times, and are buoyed up into the air by their coatings of elec tiicity; when, if condensed, they become positively electrified, but are still buoyed up by the electricity, till, on the escape of the smchatge, the particles fall as rain. It is impossible within the compass of a brief review to give an adequate idea of the ingenuity with which almost all the known phenomena of rain and storms are made to bear tribute to the author's theory. The great variety of facts which the hypothesis succeeds in explaining, renders it almost impossible to doubt that the concurrent testimony gained from the phenomena of evaporation, the suspension of clouds, the formation of rain and hail, the peculiarities of thunder-storms, and other natural phe nomena, can only be accounted for by the supposition that the hypothesis involves certain elements of the true theory — or, to speak more precisely, that it stands in some definite and perhaps simple relation to the actual truth. As an hypothesis which ex plains many facts, and may be expected to explain more, it will serve the purpose of a scaffolding by the aid of which the true science may hereafter be built up ; though, as an absolute statement of physical facts, it cannot be admitted for a moment. The argument in favour of the materiality of electricity goes no further than to say, that the contrary is not proved ; and, if this be thought a sufficient foundation for a ten • tative theory, there are other difficulties which aie quite fatal. To mention only one — the theory really requires that a va pour, or at any rate the vapour of water, should be incapable of rising in a vacuum. Mr Rowell's notion is that each particle of water is floated in the air by its attendant coat of electricity, just as a weight may be floated in water by me.ins of a bladder of air. Take away the water in the last case, and the floating body sinks with it. Take away the air in the other case, and Mr Rowell's buoyant particle would fall for the same reason. This is directly at vari ance with perfectly well -ascertained facts, and is only one of several objections against which the theory cannot possibly stand. It is worth noticing, however, in connection with this point, that a difficulty somewhat analogous and scarcely less formidable per vades all the received theories of the action of mixed gases. Any work on hydrostatics will be found to lay it down as an experi mental tenth, that different gases are as vacua to each other. The experiments on which this statement is founded are appa rently as convincing as they could possibly be. The same treatise will probably assert the equally well-established truth that a gas heavier than air will seek the lowest level — as for instance, carbonic acid gas will lurk at the bottom of a well or a vat, and can be poured like water from one glass into another — while ""hydrogen will dissipate itself at once when the top of the vessel -which contains it is opened to the air. We are not aware that these seem ingly contradictory facts have ever been reconciled, and we know that they are com monly stated without a word of comment, as if they involved no difficulty whatever. Perhaps it is not a greater defect in a theory that it makes the buoyancy of vapour de pendent on the air, while at the same time it admits the fact that vapour will diffuse itself through a perfect vacuum. But two difficulties are not like two negatives, mu tually destructive, and we cannot hesitate to reject the new theory in the form in which the authors states it. It is a euri oub fact, however, that of all the pheno mena discussed in the essay there is scarce ly one the explanation of which absolutely .requires this part of the hypothesis to be true. Replace the theory that particles of vapour are floated by the buoyancy of a material coat of electricity by the less pre cise, but less objectionable, hypothesis that the conversion of a particle of water into vapour is attended by the accession of a certain quantity of electricity, the loss of which will cause the vapour to be again precipitated — and almost the whole of Mr Rowell's reasoning would remain untouch ed, while his hypothesis would be purged of what seem to be palpable errors. In some such modified form the theory de serves consideration, not merely in refer ence to the immediate subject, but as bear ing on the relations of heat and electricity. But quite apart from the truth of the pro posed hypothesis, the skill with which the discussion is carried on, and the success •with which fact after fact is dovetailed in, give a strange interest to the book, even to those who cannot place much trust in its startling theory. The production of rain by artificial means is, upon the author's principles, the simplest thing in the world. Rain, he says, is caused by the abstraction of elec tricity from the vapour floating in the at mosphere. Thus mountains cause rain by acting as conductors, and not, as commonly assumed, by condensing the vapour — an explanation which, as Mr Rowell justly observes, requires that the mountains should generally be colder than the clouds, which is not proved, and is not likely to be generally true. If conduction of elec tricity be the agency by which mountains cause rain, any other conductor thrust into a cloud would have the same effect. Thus a conducting balloon in electrical connexion with the earth might bring down a shower of rain ; and, indeed, the author quotes a letter from the late Mr Weeks, of Sand wich, in which it is said that this effect was actually produced by so insignificant an agent as an electrical kite. This, however, is but a small incident in the general de velopment of the theory, and the real value of the book consists in the prospect which it holds out of a solution of meteorological facts which have hitherto defied the inter pretation of our ablest philosophers.",0.0,3.3899003853482185e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

18,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,19,MISCELLANEOUS.,"One of those foolish and dangerous operative strikes which, for a time, paralyse the sources of occupation, and always recoil in the end upon the workmen themselves, has just taken place in the building trades. The operatives have been for some time clamouring against both their work and their wages, and endeavouring to reduce the number of hours of their daily employment, without offering an equivalent concession in the reduction of their wages — that is, demanding ten hours' wages for nine hours' work. To this demand the masters returned a distinct and emphatic denial, upon which, by way of intimating what was to follow elsewhere, the la bourers of one great establishment left their work in a body. This movement, however, failed of the anticipated effect. Instead of being alarmed at the strike of their workmen, the masters resolved to strike themselves ; and at a large meeting convened for the purpose, they unanimously agreed to a re. solution to close all the building firms in London on the 6th of August, unless by that time the whole body of operatives had submitted, the masters re quiring that the workmen should sign a declaration repudiating in future all connection with trades' unions. In a contest of this nature Government cannot intefere. All that can be done by the au thorities is to prevent or punish outrage ; but the contest must go on till it is adjusted by the pressure of necessity on the simple, aboriginal ground of sup ply and demand. A fortnight has now elapsed since the strike commenced, and both parties are as firm as at the beginning. But the peace of the metro polis has happily been in no instance disturbed. A Belgian horticulturist, named M. Dubreuil, has recently discovered that results may be obtained by watering plants of every kind with a solution of sulphate of iron. Even the growth of fruits may be promoted in an extraordinary degree by the same process. M. Dubreuil has brought fruits to enor. mous size by watering with sulphate of iron. The trees or bushes should be watered three times in succession, after the fruit has attained about one quarter of its development, and when not exposed to the influence of the sun. The sulphate is used in the proportion of one gramme (about the 24th part of an ounce) to one litre (about a gill less than a quart) of water. The heat in Spain is greater than has been known for many years, and it has not only done damage to crops, but caused numerous sudden deaths of men and animals. At a place called Cinco Villas there had been so many fatal accidents of the kind that the local authorities had been obliged to prohibit agricultural labourers, under pain of heavy fine, from working between 10 and 4 o'clock. . It is stateg in a private letter from the Kansas gold mines that from three to five thousand claims are being successfully worked, employing about ten thousand men, and that from thirty to forty thou sand dollars' worth of gold is obtained daily. The most fearful scene that has probably ever occurred within the London Docks since their open ing happened on the forenoon of July 26. It was attended with the loss of one life. Between 9 and 10 o'clock some of the men employed on the east quay had their attention called to a particular sound proceeding from the south end of the eastern brandy vaults, and on opening the doors it at once became manifest that a fire was raging amongst the brandy. It should be here stated that this portion of the pro perty covered between 10 and 1 1 acres of ground, forming four distinct compartments of cellarage, separated by party walls and double iron doors. In these four departments were deposited many thou sand "" pieces "" of brandy. From the dense vapour emitted it was manifest that the flames had obtained possession of no inconsiderable number of brandy casks, and all the engines stationed at the different entrances to the various warehouses, as well as the hands employed, were summoned to the place, and the company's powerful floating engine was also draughted to the 1 edge of the basin. Many made attempts to get to the spot where the flames com menced, but they were obliged to return very quickly, almost exhausted. The fire brigade en gines, however, soon reached the spot. The first thing sought to be accomplished was to do what the local firemen were unable, and for that purpose the different hose from the two steam floats and several land engines were taken into the long range of vaults. The moment the water was discharged the most serious part of the day's proceedings com menced, for all of a sudden a cry was raised, "" A man off the float in the water."" He had gone on the dock floating engine to assist in working it, but by some means he lost bis equilibrium and fell into the water. The drags were at once obtained, and whilst the men were dragging for the poor fellow, a still more fearful scene happened. Mr Fogo and Mr Henderson, with about 20 of the fire brigade, and some 30 or 40 dock hands, went into the cellars for the purpose of reaching the fire, but they were struck down by the heated vapour, and became insensible. For the space of a few minutes it was feared that the whole of them had perished, when the brigade lamps were lighted, and others were sent down to render assistance, but the moment they reached the vault, so strong was the vapour that the lights in their lamps were extinguished. The men were then left in total darkness, and it was impossible to tell in what portions of the cellars they were, owing to the vast accumulation of vapour. The patent smote jacket was then sent for, but owing to the narrow ness ot the passages between the rows of casks of brandy it could not be used, and ropes were obliged to be dropped into the vaults, and the firemen and others, with the assistance of those not so much ex hausted, assisted in hauling the men out. They were at once taken to * couple of sheds, where Dr. Brown, the brigade medical officer, and nearly 20 of the local medical gentlemen attended, and did all that was possible to restore the sufferers. Fortu nately their labours were crowned with *uccess. The body of the man who fell off the dock float was ex tricated in about seven minutes. It was placed in a warm bath ; but owing to the poisonous nature of the water into which he had fallen it was found that life was extinct. The fire brigade and also the dock, firemen kept to their work, and many thousand gal lons of water were thrown amongst the brandy casks, but in spite of which the conflagration could not bfr said to be entirely extinguished until late in the af ternoon, when the vapour had so far cleared off that the fiiemen were enabled to re-enter and examine the place, when they found that about 50 casks of brandy had been destroyed, and a great number of other "" pieces"" of brandy severely damaged — many of the casks having the wooden hoops burned off, and the casks being kept together only by tin 1 iron bandages. The official report describes the damage done as follows : — The stock of brandy in three arches destroyed, and the goods in another partly consumed. It is unknown at present in what offices the property was insured.",0.0,2.7571321549386995e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05
6,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,7,Original Correspondence.  OUR LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS.,"To the Editor of the takanaki herald. Sir, — The interested few only read the numerous clauses in the various acts ( of the legislature of a country or colony, the multitude relying on the wisdom and integrity of their lepresentatives to see that equal justice is dealt out to all. Such is trusted to in England, but in New Plymouth I find it is not so. On my arrival in the settlement, I was desirous I to preserve my vegetables and seeds, and for this purpose took a section in the centre of the public run, near the Devon road. This section was well fenced accoiding to mj then English notion, viz., rails and paling all round, a furze hedge inside, and a lock-up gate. I discovered one morning in Feb ruary that the cattle on the run had broke in, and destroyed my whole crop. I was so annoyed that I brought an action against the party who had the run for trespass. The case came before the present Re sident Magistrate, and, the nature of the fence ex plained, I was told unless I could prove that I had a substantial four-railed fence my case must fall to the ground. I was, consequently, nonsuited, lost my ciop — which money here could not replace, and had to pay costs of the whole. I took it for granted this was the LAW for all, and I could never foiget it when putting up new fences. To my cost again, I find it is not so. Thomas Bayly is a more fortunate man than myself; he lives near what is called the Town Belt. I find that this land, with a few other favoured spots that hap pened to be in cultivation prior to 1854, have a very different law. The act positively says that this por tion of land, whether fenced or unfenced, shall be subject to the law ol trespass, and damages aie re coverable from the less.ee of the runs adjoining these lands after being let to the highest bidder at public auction. Bight good use does Thomas Bayly make of this extraordinaiy and unheard of act ; it is a very profitable it ap to him ! I have for years wondered why Thomas (a proper farmer !) should have such a miserable fence in so dangeious a situation, viz., a poor two-rail fence, with hire and theie only one rail stuck in a rotten post, through which as often his own cattle bleak as do those on the lun, when all go in together, and he comes upon the lessee for damages, unless an agreement has been made pre vious. I find, upon enquiry, that Thomas has his price veiy regulaily ; a foimer lessee paid him 30s. per month, and another an equal amount weekly, to keep the peace j I am mulcted in the sum of 30s. for the first thice weeks of my lease — thus making I a good round sum of £18 or £20 per annum cre ditably obtained. This would not appear so bad probably, weie his fence on his own land ; but he has some acres of the public run enclosed in this miseiable fence, for which, I suppose, he pays a mere nominal quit rent. This ought not to be, and the proper authorities knowing this, should guard the lessee, if not by a diiect repeal of this statute, by protection from such expensive trouble, and vex ation to their tenants. I would earnestly recommend neighbour Thomas to act like honest John at home, and put an end to this vile trap by surrounding his own cultivated land with a good tluee-iail fence, similar to all his neighbours, and he will find more satisfaction in the \ £ s. d. obtained properly, than by all his manceuvr ing to grasp improper damages. Had he biought mo to the Magistrate's Court, for which I was wait ing, the result would have been very different ; but he comes through another tiibunal of which I was ignorant, and an umpire is to be found who can rely upon the ipse dii.it of Thomas alone and such fenc ing, and awards 255. for Thomas, and ss. for him self, against which there is no appeal. Oh fie ! ! I fed it a duty to myself and the public, to try to remedy this existing evil, and hope, Mr Editor, you will find room in your columns and oblige the pub lic as well as Your obedient servant, The Llsseb or No. 1 Run.",0.0,2.5117009755292223e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05
102,1895-01-16,WSTAR,Western Star,17,A NOTABLE PRIEST.,"Pather Healy, the renowei parish priest of Bray and of Ballybrack, near Dublin, has just died. Without am bition or effort he became famous on both sides of the Channel as the com plete embodiment of Irish yeist. Por bis friends it was as though one had happened to meet in the flesh the real, living John Bull or Uncle Sam or Sandy of tradition. The sort of things the typical Irishman says in stores, and is expected to say often, Pather Healy actually said, quite spontaneously, never to effect; quaint, profound, ludicrous ideas and sayings bubbled from his lips naturally and incessantly. Irish s icioty, having discovered Paihor Healy, never let him go to last, lie was sought after by Dublin dinner givers, such as Lords Londonderry, Ardilaun, Powerscourt, and Wolseley. Popolar belief ranks him as one of those rare beings—a Unionist priest. Actually he was not much of a politi cian—dined with tho Unionists and agreed with the Nationalists.

14,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,15,THE RAJAH OF SARAWAK.,"[From the Times.'] About twenty years ago, and English gentleman embarked in his yacht for the Eastern Seas — a le gion then but little known. The Dutch had done their best to shroud that rich portion of the earth's surface in mystery, for they wanted no rivals in the spice trade. When the mariners of any other nation had approached its limits, they hung out every sail to the perfumed breeze, for every creek and islet could send forth swift galleys, manned by a fierce and desperate race, to attack the travellers if they were becalmed. Within the Straits of Malacca and of Sunda all was mystery and apprehension. We are talking of what was — not what is. Our grand fathers trotted in the dark over Hounslow-heath with feelings very different from tliose of their des cendants as they are shot oyer the same tract of country in an express train. Two of the great and special services which Sir James Brooko has ren dered to this country are, first — that he has reduced this phantom of Dutch supremacy to just and intel ligible proportions ; and, secondly, that he has al most entirely suppressed the atrocious system of pi racy which so often tinged the waters of the Indian Archipelago with human blood. But as a private English gentleman he went forth without any other strongly defined purpose in his mind than that of exploring the Archipelago. He visited then for the first time, the Sarawak River, which was destined to be so imperishably associated with his name. He found the place the scene of civil broil, of oppres sion and blooodshed. After a time he departed and returned; but being earnestly entreated by the chiefs who represented the cause of order in that distracted State, he consented to interfere, and in an incredibly short space of time, and with scarcely any damage even to the losing party, restored to the Province — rather created in it, peace, contentment, and plenty. The administration of the province was soon ceded into his hands, and the private gen tleman became in all but name a Cinq. This is the point which to our apprehension is the most remark able one in Rajah Brooke's career. When the Go vernment was intrusted to him, he resolved to try an experiment which had never yet been tried. He, a European, resolved to govern these Asiatics, not only for themselves, but by themselves. It waß not as in Paraguay, where the Jesuits dealt with the natives as Highland shepherds deal with their flocks and herds ; nor as in Mexico and Peru, v, here the Spaniards use their right of conquest even to the ex termination of the conquered. There is no instance in ancient or modern history of such arc expeiiment as that which has hitherto been worked out success fully by Sir James Brooke in Borneo. The pro vince of Sarawak is governed by a native council for the benefit of the native inhabitants. The Euro pean ruler advises and guides, but he does not go vern or direct. As far as depends upon Rajah Brooke, the country is as puiely in the enjoyment of freedom as the British Islands. Sir James Brooke has been decorated by his Sove reign, he has received the hearty support of the lead ing statesmen of this country, he he has been tri umphantly acquitted at Singapore when charges af fecting his character had been brought against him. The flag of Sarawak has been acknowledged by the British Government. How is it, it may then be asked, that such a man is diiven to claim the help of his countiymen? The answer is a very simple one. As ruler of Sarawak he was holding his own when this, country became involved in hostilities with China. The first violent outbreak of the Chi nese against the British took plare at Sarawak, and Sir James Brooke was reduced for the moment to fly for his life. This would have been nothing, a mere incident in his career, had life and stiength held out ; but when he had quelled the Chinese in surrection in Borneo, and thereby, according to the common opinion of the Sraits' Settlements, had saved Singapore from similar danger, he returned to this country to obtain further recognition from the Bri tish Government. In the midst of his efforts he was struck down by paralysis. Therefore, it is, that a list has been formed comprising the names of the noblest and most distinguished persons in these is lands, who arc endeavouring to restore to him some portion at least of a fortune every shilling of which has been expended upon objects so noble and philanthropic.",0.0,2.2847400724240855e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

15,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,16,IS NAPOLEON THE SECOND ALIVE?,"One of the latest historical romances of our cou sins the Americans, is flue having reference to the query adopted above as a heading, and may be taken as an ingenious specimen of what has been called "" the lie, with circumstance."" The Knickerbocker or New York Monthly Maga ztne t tells its readers that, 1 ' according to a most ve racious correspondent, who rolls himself up in a ball of irrefragable argument in support of his case, as he goes along, ' We have a Napoleon 11. among us !' There is ' no mistake about.' Let us reduce and in troduce our correspondent's story : — He says that one pleasant Sunday, in July, being at a meeting of the Lebanon Shakers, at their ' North House,' he was struck with the astonishing resemblance which one of the brethren bore to Napoleon Bonaparte, with whose family features, during a long residence in Europe, he had been familiar, especially with Louis Napoleon, whom he had ' often met face to face.' He found this impresrion had been made upon all to whom he had spoken, who had visited the Shakers on their worship days, or encountered the individual referred to alone in the long street of the village. A broken legged accident (he wn» ' thrown from a horse,' and fractured his right lower ' limb, 1 ) caused him to bo ' taken up ' and conveyed to the nearest family house of the brethren. And here it was that he became acquainted with ' Bro ther Joseph,' as he was called, who used to visit him, and hold long talks with him. One evening, in the course of conveisation, the invalid spoke of his great resemblance to Napoleon. An answering smile excited his curiosity, and caused him to press for a reply. One by one, the particulars were drawn away from ' Brother Joseph,' a few of which we now proceed to set foith : — The student of French his tory will remember that the Empeior Napoleon was married to Maria Louisa on the 11th day of March, 1810. The King of Rome was born early in 1811. It is the received opinion that, after the fall of his father in 1814, he was transferred tn Vienna, and there educated under the paternal superintendence of the Austrian Court ; and that he finally died a victim to the dissipation taught and encouiaged by his loving lelatives. This is the tale by which the world has long been deluded. Its truth will appear from the following facts :— After the fatal termina tion of the Russian campaign, the battle of Leipsic, and the entiies of the allies into France, Bonaparte found himself compelled to abdicate. He foresaw that he should be banished from France, and his wife and child become prisoneis of the Allies. He had no fears for his wife, but he felt that the life of his son, the heir to his crown, would not be safe in the power of the Austriansj that they would never suffer him to reach maturity; fearing, and with justice, lest the French people should one day rally round the son of the great Emperor, drive out the Bourbons, and place him upon the throne of his fathei, he determined to confide the child to some tried and faithful servant, who would escape with him to America, while an infant of the same age should, with the consent of the Empress, be sub stituted for her child. This arrangement was car ried out. The child was intrusted to Louis Poinet, an old soldier of the Guard, whose fidelity had been proved amid the sands of Egypt and the snows of Russia. Poinet succeeded in escaping. He sailed from Rochefort early in May, 1811, in a small American brig, called the Ann Eliza. After a te dious passage the exiles landed in Boston, in July of the same year. They remained there during five or six months. Poinet then determined to remove into the inteiior of the State, where the chance of discovery would be less, and his moderate means would go farther towards their support. He had picked up a smattering of our language from the English prisoners in France, and without much dif ficulty he made his way through the interior ; some times in the stage coach, and sometimes on foot, until he reached the town of Pittsfield, in the west ei n part of the State then an inconsiderable village. Here he resided for several years, otten in great distress ; for, as may be supposed, the remittances from the Emperor, during his exile in Elba, the short pei iod of his power in France, and his impri sonment on the rock of St. Helena, were always de layed, and, in fact, often failed to reach him at all. When the young prince was nine years of age Poinet confided to him the secret of his birlh. He showed him letters from the Emperor. He gave him one addiessed to himself, written years before, with a diiection endorsed that it was to be delivered to his son when old enough to comprehend its meaning, and realize its importance. In this letter the Em peror spoke of his approaching exile j of his certainty that the life of his son would not be safe in the power of the Austrians ; and of his determination to send him in charge of Poinet, to America ; there to remain in retirement until the day should come 1 and come it would,' when France should rouse from her sleep, hurl her imbecile rulers from the throne, and call upon the son to fill the place of his father, and lead her to victory, to vengeance, and renown. The letter concluded with an injunction to place all confidence in what was told him by Poinet, and implicitly to obey his directions The young prince was about ten when Poinet died, leaving him but a small sum of money for his sup . port. This was soon exhausted. No further re mittances arrived, and he was thrown upon his own sources. After suffering from want, he was induced by the persuasions of some of the Shakers, with whom he fell in, at Pittsfield, to join their commu nity. It assured him, at least, a home, and the ne cessaries of life. Here he grew up to man's estate ; became attached to his faith ; and lemainedin quiet retirement, until the time when I made his acquaint ance. During this long period but one event of in terest had interrupted the even tenor of his life. That, however, was an event of much significance. This event was nothing less than a visit Irom Bro ther Joseph to Louis Napoleon, at that time in this country, who went up to Lebanon to induce him to 'sign off' in his favour, which ' Brother Joseph' declined peremptorily to do ; but ' the parties sepa rated on good terms.' In fact, it seems as if there could be no better terms than what ' the parties • separated on. But we think it would only have been prudent for ' Brother Joseph' to have kept a copy of the document which Louis Napoleon wanted him to sign. It was handsome to look at, being en grossed on ' vellum, with the Imperial Eagle at tached — a splendid looking bird.' The narrative proceeds : — Thus far, it will be observed that the S roof of the identity of ' Biother Joseph 'with the of Rome, rests principally upon his own cre dibility. Were this all, although his character for truth is undoubted, <md, in a question of veracity between Louis Napoleon and the Shaker, the world would give preference to the latter, still this narra tive would not have been written. Fortunately, however, the story is confirmed by many curious circumstances, each, perhaps, of little importance in itself, but which, taken together, forms a mass of proof difficult to be withstood. Marks upon the person, articles in his possession, his knowledge of the French language, and, above all, his singular likeness to the Bonaparte family, strongly confirm the accuracy of the account. I pass over aa un worthy of record, in a serious article of this charac ter, his dreamy recollections of his early youth ; the rich uniforms by which hewas surrounded ; elegant ly-dressed ladies ; a large room filled with pictures of men in coats covered with embrodiery and stars, possibly the Salle-des-Marechaux ; a park or gar. den, with fountains, flowers, marble statues, with children playing, probably, the Tuileries. Ido not consider these reminiscences as proof ; for all experience shows that, if the memory is taxed to re call events, which it is our interest should have happened, the scene soon arises before the mind. Imagination is taken for memory. Not so, however, with the proofs I shall record. No imagination can detect marks upon the person which do not exist. No imagination can hear the French tongue, where the English only is spoken. It is probably known to every reader at all familiar with the history of Napoleon, that the young King of Rome, while playing with an open knife carelessly left in the room, had the misfortune to inflict a severe wound upon the hand. The wound was upon the second joint of the forefinger of the left hand. Strange as it may appear, a scar, evidently from a cut, is to be found upon the same finger of ' Brother Joseph's ' left hand Several of our most learned phy sicians have found a curious mark upon the inside of the elbow-joint of ' Brother Joseph's ' left arm ; a similar maik we know to have been upon the arm of the King of Rome Farther, ' Brother Joseph ' has in his possession a trunk of the form and size of the ordinary French packing box. It is a common looking trunk having nothing in its ap pearance to awaken suspicion ; and yet, a careful examination of the inner side of the lid discloses the name and residence of the maker, almost obliterated by time. This name is French and the residence is the Rue St. Honore, Paris ! This trunk, or box, has been in the possession of ' Brother Joseph ' as long as he can remember j and proof is not wanting that he brought it with him when he joined the Shakers. Now, the idea that a French trunk was to be purchased in Pittsfield previous to the year 1821, is an absurdity which no reader of sense will for a moment think of entertaining. In this trunk are contained several articles which go far to confirm the story, so singularly proved by the trunk itself. Amongothers, parts of an infant's clothing, and a medal, or coin. The clothing is such as is worn by children two or three years of age: a plain, white dress, but trimmed with lace of the most costly des cription, such as could have belonged to an infant of a noble or royal family. Upon the skirt of the dress in large size, and beautifully executed, is embroi dered the Imperial 'N. It requires no active imagination to draw the inference to whom this dress must have belonged His knowledge of the French language : Is this common among the Shakers ? Search all the establishments of the sect, from Maine to Missouri ; examine every member of the persuasion, male or female, and I doubt if, with one exception, a single individual can be produced who can speak ten words of that tongue. Where was he to acquire it ? French teachers were not plentiful in Pittsburgh in 1820. Had there been a regiment of them it would have been a difficult matter for a poor boy, who needed food and clothing more than French, to have procured their instruc tion. His pronunciation, too, is not that of a fo reigner acquiring French. His knowledge of the words of the language is limited— probably he has forgotten them — but the accent is pure If the facts which I have already offered have failed to shake the incredulity of the sceptic, the last and most impoitant testimony I shall adduce cannot fail to stagger his disbelief. I allude, of course, to ' Brother Joseph's ' resemblance to Napoleon. This resemblance must strike the most unobserving ; and I can only ascribe it to a want of acquaintance among our people with the features of the Emperor that it has not been before recorded. The same prominent thoughtful forehead ; the same cold, reflective gray eye ; the same small mouth ; the lips thin and firm ly compressed ; and, above all, the same bold and aquiline nose ; a nose, be it remarked, not the com mon aquiline protuberance common on the Conti nent, but less marked in its prominence, and more delicate in its chiselling; the nostrils thin, and easily dilated with scorn or passion. The nose, at all times a marked feature, is, in the Bonaparte fa mily, most distinctive. The resemblance in the fi gure, too, is remarkable. When standing, 'Brother Joseph,' strikes the observer as a short man. When seated, he is of, at least, averag* height. This pe culiarity of the Bonapartes has often been observed. In Louis Napoleon it is marked ; in ' Brother Jo seph ' it is so striking as to be almost ridiculous . . .... It is not my object to establish the claims of ' Brother Joseph ' to the throne of France. He is contented with his lot, and has no desire to exchange his happy obscurity for the anxieties and dangers of a crown. Louis Napoleon too, holds his position, not by virtue of his birth, but by the choice of the French people. How that choice was eft'ected, whether it was free or forced, I cannot here inquire. An ardent Republican, I still look forward to the day when the principles of civil and religious liberty will triumph over the active hostility of the despots of Russia and Austria, and the passive indifference of the French people. Should the revelations hero made shake the throne of the Emperor of the Fieuch and so contribute to the glorious cause, my purpose will have been fully attained.",0.0,1.3624000712074968e-05,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

In 'a farming community such as this, however brief the period of relaxation may have been, every one has just to settle down to what is called “ hard grafting.” The bulk of the shearing was over by the end of ’94, and every thing is going on as if there had been no break at all. Our annual festivities were as successful as usual and on a scale similar to previous years. The weather has been exceed ingly favourable for all requirements, and if our products were not at such a discount, as meantime they happen to be, no one would be feeling sad at heart at all, which might not have been the best thing possible, Of the crops the lint crop is ex cellent and ranks first. The oat crop is also looking well, but I have seen grass more abundant, and there seems to be a splendid show for turnips. The is limited in area, and as there is little or no grass being harvested to the north reaching to Poverty Bay, those who have a fair crop may expect perhaps a more remunerative figure for grass seed this year. The va’ue of stock seems falling rapidly, and the low price offered for fat stock for freezing is making those who would by this time be purchasing very chary of operat ing.

9,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,10,To the Editor of the Colonist.,"Sir, — Having seen in last week's Examiner some allusion to a report which is said to be current here, to the effect that certain natives of Queen Charlotte's Sound <ire about pioceeding to Tarauaki to join the ""turbulent Chief Wiiemu Kingi,"" and likewise having been frequently questioned on the subject during the past week, I wish to state what I know of it. A number of natives belonging to the Ngatirahiri tiibe, or Hapu, residing at Onakiwa, in the S.W. aim of the Sound, have resolved to depart and re turn to the land of their fathers, whence they were driven many years ago by the conquering Waikato tribes j but they have no sympathy with Wnemu Kingi, that chiet being principally connected with the Ptiltctapu tribe, a branch of which resides at Ohamaru, in the nortli entiance of the Sound. From long and intimate acquaintance with the Queen Charlotte's Sound natives, I am only sur prised that they have not all, long ago, rpturned to Taranaki. Not a year has elapsed 6ince 1843 with out a lengthened discussion of this (to them) most interesting question, mid each year several families I have left, and are constantly entreating their rela tions to follow them to their father land ; or, as they emphatically call it, ""Te Kainga"" — "" The Home."" The natives of the Sound have consequently gra dually decreased during the last 15 years, and I am of opinion that shortly very few will be left in that district. The wonder is that they have remained so long theie, seeing that they have so little land suit able for cultivation, and that they possess abundance of good level land at Taranaki, where they can have the help of the plough, instead of the spade and the hoe. Another strong reason why these natives wish to leave, is, they have discovered that the spot on which they reside, and have their principle cultivations, is within the boundary claimed by, and awarded to, the late Joseph Toms, and since sold by his execu tors to Mr Augustus Hood, of Queen Charlotte's Sound, and as they have now no farther right to the place, they have ceased to feel any interest in it, and have resolved to go where they can peaceably settle down on their own lands, which their fathers I held in bygone years. I During the last few months frequent conferences on the subject of their departure have been held, I both in the Sound and at Motueka, where a part of the Ngatirahiri tribe resides ; and as the deputa. tions have gone to and fro, I have been made ac quainted with their decisions. And I can safely asseit that I believe the natives of the Ngatirahiri tribe are the most industrious, inoffensive, and well, disposed of any in the Nelson province, and that they entertair/the highest respect for the Govern ment, and are decidedly opposed to the Native King movement, regarding it (to use their own expression) as "" a child's plaything."" Nothing, therefore, is to be feared from their re turn to Taianaki ; and I have no doubt, should they be at a loss for a vessel to convey them thither, Mr Hood would very naturally offer no obstacle to their departure, as he would only be too happy to get possession of the valuable and beautiful spot on which they at present reside, and which belongs to him by purchase, as before mentioned. It appears that many of the natives of Motueka are about leaving in company with their friends of Queen Charlotte's Sound, so that only few of the Ngatirahiri tribe will remain in this island, and they will probably ere long follow their relatives. Altliough it may appear desirable that large bo dies of natives should not concentrate in the neigh bourhood of Taranaki while the old Chiefs are living, the presence of such industriously disposed natives as the Ngatirahhi will prove a benefit rather than an injury to the European settlers. I am, Sir, yours, &c, W. Jenkins, Native Interpreter. The Dun Mountain Mine. — We understand that favourable advices have been received by the last mail from the London Directors of the Dun Mountain Copper Mining Company. The half yearly general meeting of the shareholders had taken place, and it had been resolved to leave the affairs of the mine to the entire management of the direc tois. We are glad to learn that chromate of iron is now more in demand in the English market ; and it is believed that the mineral can be shipped from Nelson, so as to afford a margin of profit to the shareholders. This and other considerations have induced the directors to forward instructions to the local managers here to the effect that the proposed line of railway is to be at once surveyed and prepa rations made with a view of laying down the rails, and shipping the chrome in quantity to England. Already a surveyor is engaged on the work, and we hope shortly to report the completion of the line of railway, followed by the shipment, in large quan tities, of a valuable article of export. — Examiner, October 19.

16,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,17,UNTITLED,"A balloon voyage has recently been made in A merica, which has eclipsed that famous one made some years ago by our veteran aiironaut Green, who succeeded in making a journey from this country to Nassau. The distancp travelled by Messrs Wise, La Montaine, Gazer, and Hyde, was not less than 1,200 miles, the time occupied being 19 hours. The balloon, with its aeronauts, left St. Louis, on the Mississippi, one Friday evening, at 20 minutes past 7 o'clock, and arrived at the termination of its career at 20 minutes past 2 on Saturday, having passed over in its course the entire length of Lake Erie, and crossing between Buffalo and the Niagara Falls.

26,1897-12-02,LCP,Lake County Press,6,Sporting Notes.,"[By Peeping Tom.] I hear very good accounts of the doings of Tiapo, Frank, and Little Jane, on the train ing tracks. If this trio are as good as they are reputed to be, we ought to witness some fast trotting at Franktou and Cromwell. Old Langley has changed hands. The price I understand is a trifle over £2 a leg. The old horse ought to be cheap for hacking purposes alone. It is hardly likely that his new owner will race him much. He may give Langley one spin at Frankton, without going to the bother of training him. A better looking horse than his sire ever was, was the verdict of competent judges, when Silvercrown was led into the show ring at Cromwell. Those who saw Silvermark after his victory in, the Lake County Cup, must remember a very fine looking blood horse indeed, but it is said that his d-year-old Bon, out of Stockflower, is altogether a better furnished animal. If the Apermont and Tu bal Cain blood nicks well, then Mr J. Cowan’s fine looking colt ought to turn out a top sawyer. All admirers of a good sportsman and straightgoing owner will be pleased to see the popular blue jacket and black cap frequently in the van, during the forthcoming goldfield’s meetings. Looking through the Lake County pro gramme, I notice that there are no conditions attached to the Maiden Plate. Is tne race for horses that have never won public money ? or, can horses that have won a stake, say of £lO, have a cut for it ? I think this ought to have been specified on the programme, as owners of the last named class of hcrses will, be concerned to know if their nags are eligible or net. Regarding hack and handi cap races, I presume that a horse can compete in hack or handicap races as best suits the owner,, and be nominated for all events at the meeting same as last year. It is cheering to note per Cromwell Argus that the privileges in connection with the forthcoming race-meeting of the C.J.C. have realised a sum total in excess of last year’s amount. Mr M. Dawson, the popular sport, and now Licensee of the Globe Hotel, scour ing the publican's booth for the substantial sum of L<ss. The fields at the late spring meeting of the D.J.C. were comparatively small lor a metropolitan fixture, and there is a distinct shrinkage in tie totalisator investments. As a result of the racing, the fact is still further emphasised that Mr G. G. Stead’s is by far and away the strongest racing stable in New Zealand at the present time. Multi form, Uniform, Gold Medallist, Conqueror, and Altair, is indeed a formidable team for one man to possess. Mr Stead breeds from the best and as a consequence owns the best. Two erstwhile performer? on the goldfields were slipped in the selli ig races, Stimulant and Silverstreara to wit, but neither scored a win. I notice that the last named is trained by our old friend Mr Tom M‘Kay, and it is on the cards, that the tough old son of Duntroon will be a performer at both Cromwell and Frankton. A puzzle for my sporting readers. Find the following words 1. It stops the speech. 2. A Victorian township. 3. The light of the countenance. 4. The sun’s mid journey. 5. The close of the day. 6.

57,1889-09-28,NA,Northern Advocate,2,The Northern Advocate.,"At last, after much, discussion both on the part of the public and the Council, the question of broad and narrow wheels is decided, and the by-law passed by the Council appears to us to be both just and politic. The question raised, that it would be impossible, without ruinous effects on horses, to pull Jbroad wheels through the mud of our clay roads has reason in it, and we believe it would |be difficult to adopt them after the roads are cut up. But, on the other hand, we believe it would be better for our roads, for carters, and for settlers, if broad wheels became general: that once accomplished, our roads would never be so cut up as to render their use an evil. Their use, however, should be commenced in summer and not in winter. In the good old times in England, before the fads of arti ficial manures came into vogue, and when farmers followed more closely the dictates of nature, and maintained the fertility of their soils by a rotation of crops and grazing, and farm yard manuring, to save their paddocks from destruction in carting over them, wide wheels were universal. We need not point out the ruinous effects of carting with narrow wheels over the paddocks of the district, for the wretched tracks, deep into the soil, converted into ruinous ditches, carry ing away at every fresh tons of the best soil, are to be seen on almost every farm. With lower prices and greater competition for farm produce, | we believe more economy and thought in production must come ; that the manure account must almost if not quite cease; that much must be economised and used ; and that much more carting on the farm must ensue ; and that then, the force of circum stances will compel the use of wider wheels.",0.0,5.610462982947721e-06,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/northern-advocate/1889/09/28
95,1895-01-16,WSTAR,Western Star,10,WESTWARD NOTES.,"(from our own correspondent, AH through the holiday season it has boon sports and picnics through the day and dancing at nieht. So that the holidays have merrily passed by and we are now into the turmoils of another year with its cares and sorrows. The weather has h'-en at its best, although the goldminers could do with more water. However, it is bard to please every body and the best of it is we have to take what we gel in the weather line. The fly has taken some fields of turnips twice in succession, but the third sowing ia some p'aces is looking well. Mr Printz Ims a beautiful crop of rye in full ear on apiece of [ his ground. I understand that he is going to thrash it. The yield wi'l bo watched with interest. While on ryegrass I think that all dairy farmers should go in for an acre or two every year and cut it green for their milking cow*, giving them a good sheaf of it e<ery day. They eat it greedily and it iucieases the mi k yield a good deal and makes the farmer more independ ent of anv sudden change in the weather as he can easily increase the feed of rye at any cold spell of weather when the cows are seeking shelter and do not look for feed. Another thing, it has the advantage of being very easily grown, and will stand cn'tiog all through the spring, summer and autumn if liberally top-dressed with an odd bag of bone dust. I have known two acres give a sheaf each to over2o cows for seven months in the year, and all it got was two bags of bonedust. We have that abominable weed, Tonsy some call it. I know not its proper name, but this I do know, it will kill couch, and I hear it is injurious to both horses and cattle, in some instances proving fatal. A great many confound it with our native ragwood, as it is very like it at a casual glance. Pour years ago you could have covered all of it at the Oraki railway station with an 8 by 10 feet lent. Now it is right up to Orepuki, and an odd bunch is to be seen on the Wa>au road. The railway line is the worst, and through Mr Laurie representing it to (he railw y engineer the surfacemen on the Oraki length have cut it all off to keep it from seeding. Those in charge of the Orepuki length should have it cut, as it would be a great I pity to let it get a hold in the Garden of Southland. It will be worse to clear than the original bush. So now is the time to be up and doing. A great deal of talk and writing is going on just now about the Cali fornian thistle. l or that plague I am told the following is a sure and certain cure if properly applied Scrape the earth care fully away from the root of the plant, taking care to cut none of its roots. Then cut off the head of the plant just low enough to make it bleed well (that is, throw out sap). On the top of the cut put a good handful of coarse salt ; draw in the dust carefully Ihrt has been scraped away, slightly covering the salt and the thistle will entirely disappear. The above is to he used when th« plant is growing up to maturity, not on the d'caving side. The above is the experience of a gentleman who cleared 40 acres of the pest. He tried trenching, burning and eulphur at, great expense. In two years the thistles were as bad as ever. Not so with the above treatment, as he has not a single thistle on biisland now. Through just carefully watch ing any young thistle and destroying it in this manner it is well worth a trial. The Messrs Hannan Brothers have bought Mr Brownridgo’sfarm, which has some very good timber on it, and is west cf Orepuki some six miles by road. They are going to erect a sawmill plant to cut sleepers, and they will be able to supply all Ihe local settlers with limber at comparatively their own doors It will be a great boon to the whole district besides utilising valuable timber that wou'd have been destroyed by fire to make way for grass. It is to bo hoped the trial shipment to tbo London market gf our timber will turn out well, as it will be the means of setting all our mills working again, and stop the ruthless destruction of valuable timber. A nice old gentleman of this district had a beautiful Christmas box in the shape of a son. As he and his better half have been grand parents this many years, it came as a great surprise to their many friends. I an sure one and all will wish them many returns.

While out for a little exercise on Sunday, and when in the vicinity of the ocean beach wo noticed several horses ip the various paddocks in a state of great excitement. Some were galloping about, and others lashing out with their fore feet. Thinking something was seriously wrong we approached a section in which three horses were located, all huddled together. On examination wa found the cause for all the disturbance was none other than the presence of the hot fly. No doubt the exceptionally warm weather was re sponsible for their appearance, for they were plentiful and very busy. At Night caps, ns well as in other parts of the district, the fly has made its appearance, and to prevent loss from it farmers and others will have to bs watchful and quick in applying the proper preventive. If the parts of the horse where the fly deposits its eggs are washed twice a week with a kero sene emulsion, it will not only destroy any egfS there but keo > the fly away, and stop the horse from licking those places.

21,1897-12-02,LCP,Lake County Press,1,"Lake County Press, PUBLISHED EVERY THURSDAY Arrowtown : December 2, 1897.","The trust that'* given tbee guard, and to thyself be juit. Our readers doubtless observed a local in last week's issue of the CotlJlty Press stating that Lake County Council at a pre- MattSSS. v ious meeting decided to reduce tbe workmen's wages by a shilling a day—a reduction from, 8s to Is. To the general public this curtailment in the men's weekly earning seems but little ; to those in terested* it means, a great deal. To, begin with, the motion for the reduc tion of wages was tabled in committee —in committee remember—and, as far as we can understand, the majority of the councillors knew nothing of what they were being retained for. Just imagine a very important matter like this being decided, in what we can safely term, “the twinkling of an eye.” We must complain bitterly, not alone on account of the exclusion of the Press, but on behalf of the ratepayers, of the cowardice the- councillors displayed in seeking the refuge of committee, if they are afraid to discuss such important business before the public Press, they have no right to be there. That is the short and the long of it. The only inkling we got of the discussion was when the minutes of the previous meet ing were being read for confirmation. We then noted the fact that the Council decided to reduce the wages as stated, Crs Anderson and Rogers voting against. Had we nob taken notice of the minutes, which is an unusual thing to do, these councillors would have shared the same rebuke from the editorial pen as the rest of the members. We are, however, liberal enough to believe that there are other councillors who object strongly to matters being discussed in commit tee, and who in future (we have good reason for saying this) will, at all hazards, denounce strongly committee business. It consequence of the clitnu nition in the income of the workmen, Or Rogers tabled the following notice of motion at lust meeting of the Coun cil:—“ That in the opinion of this Council, taking into consideration its present financial difficulties, it is advis able that a reduction of 25 per cent be’ made in the chairman and members travelling allowances and in the engi neer’s salary.” In support of his motion Cr Rogers said “he tabled it after care ful deliberation. The resolution passed at the previous meeting affected the weekly earnings of one class by 121 per cent, and he thought it only fair to reduce the other class by 25 ' per cent because they were better paid.” In reply to Cr Anderson, the Engineer said he received £IOO, ouo of which he had to pay his own travelling expenses in attending to the different works of the Council. Such was not the case in other districts. Since his appointment he had to fill other offices without fur ther remuneration. The amount paid to the officials of the Council prior to his taking office was £7OO a year. Cr Anderson thought that the circum stances were quite different previously. Personally he thought the salary too high at present. He considered, seeing the men had been reduced, that the reduction should be general. In the fisrt place we are of the opinion that the reduction should never have been made. Of course the councillors who favored it say that the workmen of Southland are only paid 6s a day. Well, admitting that the assertion is true, comparisons between the Lakes district and Southland are extremely odious. It is an old but true saying, “ the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it,” and those who are in a position to judge, consider that the man who re ceives 6s a day in Southland is better paid than the man who receives 8s a day in this district. We quite believe it. If, on the argument above stated, the councillors decided to make the re duction, all we can say is they have made a grevious error. Now in regard to Cr Rogers’s notice of motion. We are not altogether in accord with his proposals. There is, however, no reason why the chairman and members’ travelling allowances should not be re duced somewhat, if reduction is neces sary ; but, we fail to see why the engi neer’s salary should be reduced by such an enormous amount. Many people were of the opinion, and no doubt several still are, that travelling expenses of the engineer were paid by the Coun cil. Such is not the case. Those who have any idea of travelling know perfectly well how the money goes. We consider we are moderate when we say that the expenses of the engineer, in attending to the different works of the County, must be fully £l5O a year. Roughly speaking then, the official’s salary will be about £250. If it is further reduced, as proposed in the notice of motion, by 25 per cent or £IOO, it is not at all likely the Council will have the opportunity of retaining the services of a man as competent arid trustworthy as the present <>ffi-ial. A procedure of the kind on the Council’s part, would be unwise, and we fail to see how they can reduce the salary unless they allow the engineer his tra velling expenses. If the Council is determined to make a reduction, let it he on a more equitable basis. We would, however, suggest that the motion reducing the men’s wages be rescinded by notice of motion, for above all, the poor working man can ill afford to have his weekly earnings cut down to a star vation figure.",0.0,3.5304012020126488e-06,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/lake-county-press/1897/12/02

The N.S.W. Cabinet lias decided that the grain duties shall be retained till September 30th. This has been done to give farmers an opportunity of getting rid of their present crops. Several co-operative men have selec ted 150 acres each in the Awarua Block near the Hautapu. 'They have started to fence, and' will put 500 sheep on the land at once. Heavy x-ains have fallen in the Nelson district, and the drought seems to have been effectually broken up- On New Year’s Day a mare in a buggy driven by Mr Howell became so frightened at a passing train near Dunedin that she dropped dead at the roadside ; the shock of the fright probably acting on a weak heart. A Sydney local firm has received an order from Capetown for a quantity of the New South Wales' ornamental hardwood timber. The order is the result of samples for warded by the Government.

Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge, the new Oommander-in-Chief on the Aus tralian station, has arrived at Adelaide. The early potatoes in the Oamaru district are not turning out a tip-top crop. In many places the haulms show no tubers at the root, and the yield generally is a light one.

7,1859-11-05,TH,Taranaki Herald,8,To the Editor of the TARANAKI HERALD.,"Sir, — I have heard of people being thankful for j small mercies. Surely, Mr Editor, you are one of I such grateful folks, seeing that you can receive the reply to the Memoi ial recently sent to the Governor as ""on the whole satisf.ictoiy."" The leply is a very small incicy indeed. But, pi ay, Mr Editor, to whom is it satisfactory » Are you wilting in irony? In what respect is it salifcfactoiy ? We aie not veiy clever people here, iind our best men arc one after another being diafted away. Do then enlighten us who are left about this satisfactory reply. If you have heard some good news pray let us have it ; for it is a long time since we had any oil matters affecting the prosperity of the Piovince. In the meantime I will tell yon how I read this satisfactory leply, and I believe most others read it in the same sense. I hope it is not profanation to criticise a document fiom head-quaiters, and I am far from meaning any disiespect to those in autho rity. lam but a plain soit of person, neither a statesman nor a thorough politician : so I may bo very much out in my idea of its real meaning ; for, you know, a first -rate diplomatist and politician said tbat ""speech"" (of course, written, as well as spoken) "" was given to man to enable him to conceal his thoughts."" Therefore, you see, a non-diplomatist may greatly mistake a political document. It seems that the Chief land Commissioner lias been detained by important negotiations in Alnuiii. I thought, Mr Editor, that when the Governor and Mr McLean were at New Plymouth, some very im portant offers of land were made to them, and nego tiations opened : but though to us simple people they 6eemed the most impoitant of any for years past, it must be concluded there are reasons for , their being much less important than offere of land in Ahuriri, a Province which the Chief Commis sioner publicly stated had plenty of land already. I suppose this is all right, ""for ""we are told "" whosoever hath to him shall be given ; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which ho seemeth to have."" (Luke 8. 18.) Per haps, Mr Editor, you can tell us what is a really important offer of land in Taranaki. Natives have offered land for years past, but, in vain, and they are growing as weary of the affair as we are. ' Doubtless, their offers are not important enough. Caii you tell us anything about it ? Further, it ap pears that the Chief Commissioner has not visited Taianaki for several yeais because there has been here no opening for his exertions. Well ! that does seem cuiious, too, when land has been constantly I offered and when for the want of it the province is a pauper and insolvent on the hands of the General Assembly ; and receives a yearly "" relief"" 0f 22002. till "" something turns up."" (By the way, Mi Edi tor, why not diop the name New Plymouth, and take that of Micawber instead 1 it would be appro priate, and it sounds well.) I suppose it isn't logical to say the greater the difficulty the greater the pains lequircd to overcome it: but the entire absence of the leading and most successful native officer and land buyer does not look like taking either pains or heed. Again, Mr Editor, we are told that continual agitation of the subject (land) does harm. No doubt it does, and for this reason, we waited six months before we asked — and we tried to a6k res pectfully — why the visit of Mr McLean, promised in about two months, was put off indefinitely, and no notice taken of it. We thought we weie very quiet and patient. We said nothing about other maori matters promised to be arianged for us, but, which, I believe, are not done or begun. Mr Editor, it is clear we are a simple guileless people. We thought we were about to go ahead a little at long last, but it now turns out "" No Go "" at all. However, to avoid offence for the future, I ven ture to suggest that we do now let all agitation cease, and to carry this out effectually, that Govern ment set us the example, by "" promoting "" our Lo cal Commissioner to a better salary and location. Then we can drop the question : but it is not easy to do it so long as Government heads the agitation, as it confesses in vain. Then there may cease to be "" in the native mind an exaggerated sense of the value of their land,"" and the European residents may also cease from the vain expectation of the de velopment of the Piovince ; or, its increase in popu lation, intelligence, wealth : then will they realise what they have been reluctant to admit, that a few tmbulent maories gain more consideration than their well-disposed countrymen, and all the British settlers to boot. Dante's stern line is a fitting motto for our Pro vincial land question. Lasciate ogni speranza voi eh'entiate. "" All hope abandon ye who enter heie."" Yours, Mr Editor, Lackland. [We have already stated why we consider the Go vernor's reply to be on the whole satisfactory. We have long been of opinion that Local Land Purchase Commissioners should act independent ly of the Chief Commissioner, in order to remove the impression which exists on the native mind that land can only be bonght by him. We have full faith in the zeal and ability of Mr Parris, we moieover believe, that he will not shrink from the responsibility of bringing pending negotiations to an early issue. Untimely agitation will not ex pedite the event, but might mar its success. — Ed. T. ll.]",0.0,2.258721044158804e-06,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/taranaki-herald/1859/11/05

PBRNELL HAS DONE FOR DUBLIN.,"' A Radical Unionist,"" writing to I the Scotsman says — At the Dublin I Municipal elections of 1881 the Paruell itesobtained amajority in the Corporation, and signalised their accession to power by raising the Lord Mayor's salary* from £2,000 to £3,000 a year. The use of the Mansion House costs the city about £1,500 per annum more, and these emoluments were granted for the express purpose of enabling the Lord Mayor to discharge the functions of his office in the matter of public entertainment. The present Lord Mayor draws the salary, but does not provide the entertainment. This is a small item compared with what follows, however. On 31st Dec, ISBI, there was a credit balauce on the total of the corporate accounts of £28,753; 31st Dec, 1887, there was a debit balance of £5,553. Again, on 31st Dec, 1881, the mortgage and bonded debts on the City Estate, tho Improvement Fund, and tho Water Fund amounted to £967.064 ; on 31st Dec, 1887, the amount of these debts increased to £ 1 , 1 50,009.

A. correspondent of the Wanganui Herald gives an interesting account, of d dugs in connec inn with the survey at Waimate Plains. The Parihaka meeting is said to be attracting many Maoris and Rewi is likely to attend. The survey of the Plains is proceeding satisfactorily, and natives are showing a diispoii'ion to trade and even to act generously towards men of tue survey party by making presents of food. The proposed railway from Normanby through the Plains to Oeo, it ia con> side red would prove profitable, espe cially if continued to Opunake, where, for an expenditure of £2000, a safe-at all-times harbor could be made, which would accommodate sieamors like tho Wellington and Taranaki, and other drawing over 10 feet ol water.

25,1897-12-02,LCP,Lake County Press,5,Bannockburn.,"(lake county press correspondent.)-. November 28. The first cricket match of the season was played here last Wednesday between teams representing Cromwell and Bannockburn,, and resulted in a win for the former by seven runs. The scores were (Ist innings) Cromwell 64, Bannockburn 57. I have not heard of any fixtures for the future. Last Friday a social and dance was held in the hall in ai-i of the Bannockburn Brass Band. The several items on the programme were very good, and deserved a far larger house than the one that faced the performers. After expenses tue band will benefit to about £2. I have always held, and still maintain, that it is a big mistake not to properly advertise socials and concerts. The band committee had a first-class pro gramme—nothing to be ashamed of—and had they published a full program r.e with, singers’ names, also the songs and other different items, charged 2s instead of Is, there would have been a far better house,. When the. public see no programme and see the charge is only is, they are chary, and I fancy sometimes, wisely ; but as I said before, with a fair programme the committee have nothing to be afraid of. People talk of hard times and no money and Is is enough, but it is surprising where the money comes from if a good performance is to be held. The old saying, “ Good wine needs no recommendation,” is all very well, but st.ll we like to taste it before investing, I do not know if I am going out of the beaten track, bat still as far as the majority is concerned I am wrong in not making it a rule to start my notes with an account of the weather.

The rehearsal on the previous Wednesday had evidently acted as an incentive to all who appeared on this occasion to excel their previous efforts. Ihe result was gratifying in every sense of the word.

104,1895-01-16,WSTAR,Western Star,19,STORIES THAT STIR THE BLOOD.,"Sin Evelyn Wood’s Reminiscences Sir Evelyn Wood in the Fortnightly continues his papers on the Crimea, 1854 and 1894 He deals this month •with Balaclava and Jnkennan. The chief interest of his papers is in the stories which he tells of individual heroism and of endurance. I extract a few, chiefly relating to the charges of the Heavy and Light Brigades' at Balaclava: — I Lieutenant Sir William Gordon, who greatly distinguished himself in personal combats in Central India in 1858, is still an active man, although the doctors said, on the 25th October he was 44 their only patient with his head off.” so terribly had he been hacked by a crowd of Russians into which ho penetrated. He used to make little of his escape, but wo learnt that after being knocked out of the saddle lie lay on his horse’s neck, trying to keep the blood frora bis eyes. Event ually, without sword or pistol, he turned back, and, unable to regain his stirrups although a. perfect horseman, rode at a walk up the valley. He found between himself and our Heavy Bri gade a regiment of Russian cavalry facing up the valley. He was now joined by two or three men, and he inade for the squadron interval. The nearest Russians, bearing him approach looked back, and by closing outwards to bar his passage, left sufficient open ing in the squadron, through which Gordon passed at a canter."" He was followed, and summoned to surrender, and refusing, would have been cut down had not bis pursuer been shot. We know that a cornet, rich in worldly possessions, whose horse was killed well down in the valley near the guns, liept his head, and extracting thesaddle, carried it back into camp on his head. Lieutenant Percy Smith, IBth Light Dragons, from an accident to bis right hand, carried merely a dummy sword in the scabbard. While leading his men on the far side of the Russian battery, a Russian soldier, perceiving he had no sword, galloped up alongside and resting his carbine on the left arm, pressed the muzzle close to Smith’s body as the two horsemen galloped, locked together. Smith presently, finding the suspense intolerable, struck at the Russian’s face wiUh the maimed hand, and the carbine going off, the bullet passed over Smith’s bead; the Russian then leaving him alone. The Naval brigade sent doctors down to attend to the wounded, and they described to us that evening the the effect of some of the sword cuts in flicted by our dragoons on the heads of the Russians as appaling ; in some .crises the head-dress and skull being diyided down to the chin. The edge of.the-sword was used, for the great coats worn by the Russians were dif ficult, to pierce with the point. In those dayspurinen. .. wore - taught the sword exercise with great regard for regularity, each cut being followed in correct sequence by its correspond ing guard. A doctor, dressing a wound in one cf our men’s head, asked “ And how did you get this ugly cut.” The trooper replied with much warmth, “ I had just cut five at a Russian, and the damned fool never guarded at all, hut hit me over the head” ! Pew Rus sians had made any attempt to sharp en their swords. Many of our men survived after receiving au incredible number of cuts, and a private of the 4th Dragoon Guards had fifteen.cats' on his head, none of which were more -than skin deep. Tin’s and the faulty leading of the .Russian officers account for the very slight loss incurred by the Heavy Brigade, seventy-eight killed and wounded. Here is the story about Sir William Hewett’s disobedience to orders at Inkerman:— When the Russians were seen on the Inkerman crest, and were observed emerging from the Careenage ravine and approaching the battery, a message was sent to Mr Hewett to spike his gun and retire. This order was deliv ered at a critical moment. Hewit had been firing at, and keeping back some of the enemy who attrmpted to approach on the ridges in his right front, but now one or more companies which had a cended the Careenage raviue out of sight of the batery, were advancing by, and bad got within two hundred jard of the right flank of the batery. The gun could not be trained to reach I hem as the embrasure confined its “ field ” of fire, but Hewitt was quick of re source, and alter one more round, as the gun was being reloaded, he gave the word, “ Four handspikes muzzle to the right'” and trained the gun so that its muzzle rested against the earthem flank wall of bis battery. Turning to the messenger who was repeating the order, he shouted. “ Retire !—retire be damned !—Fire and a mass of earth, stones and gabions was driven by the projectile and IGibs. of powder into the faces of the victory shouting Russians, who struck by this wide-spreading ei,temporised shell, fell back discomfited. Uur infantry pur sued them, being led on most gallantly by one officer, the only man just then in red, the others wearing great coals.",0.0,8.46411077480182e-07,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/western-star/1895/01/16

The horse is exactly fitted for producing cavalry horses so much wanted for India. His appear ance specks volumes: comment is unnecessary. Every year greater exception is taken by judicious parents to the mixed character of our public school system, and a return to private tuition, especially for girls. The establishment of Miss Gledhill offers the opportunity to gratify this wish. The next quarter commences on the Ist prox. To remove a wrong impression which has arisen in connection with the Volunteer Social, we have been asked to state that no charge will be made for ladies. Some time ago it was announced that Major- General Edwards, a distinguished officer who arrived from India for the purpose of examiuing the defences and defence forces of the colonies and who has for some time past being en gaged in the performance of these duties, would be unable to visit New Zealand. Considerable disappointment was felt in consequence, as pre parations had been for general inspections, etc. We are now glad to be able to state, on the authority of Lieutenant-Colonel Shepherd, in command of the Auckland volunteer district, that an inspection of the Auckland Volunteers will te held by General Edward 3 on the 16th October, and in allprobability a sham flight will also take place. As soon as full details are to hand, district .orders, calling the parades, will be published. Mr Bayne, photographer, has produced a series of views of the tableaux exhibited in Whangarei a few weeks since, copies of which he has ileft us.

The details of each picture are perfect, there being no distortion in any figure, resulting from being out of focus or out of plane.

The Australasian says: — In London rents, and provisions, and clothing are all exceedingly cheap, and we may safely say, that a pound Stirling will purchase there at least one and a half times as much as it would purchase in ' Victoria. These are facts which should be kept in view when discussing the question of London working classes. We understand that Miss Hamlin relinquish ed her duties at the Whaugarei school an Wed nesday, and that she left for Auckland on the following morning. It is pleasing to learn of the mutual good will which exists between this young lady and the children of her standard, which was evidenced from the fact that the children spontaneously subscribedjto procure a souvenir for their teacher. This presant took the form of a handsome hand bag containing a silk pockethandkerchief. We join the children in wishing her success and happiness in her future duties. Last Saturday night the rink was no ex ception to the rule, another good audience as sembled. The attractions for the evening were a potato race and a quarter-of-a-mile hurdle race. The former was won by H. Cooke and the latter by G. Ormsby. On Wednesday evening there was another good house, wheu Mr Salmon gave a very graceful skating ex hibition, for which he was loudly applauded. After this a pair race took place, which was won by Miss Courtney and Mr Ormsby, time 1 mm. 42 sec. This was a very closely contes ted race, only three seconds separating the first and last couple. On Saturday evening there will be a Siamese race and some gymnastic performance. Next Wednesday evening the great skating festival will take place, when the irst professional skater who has appeared in Whangarei will make his bow. We referred to Professor Durney's performance last week. n addition to this there will be an acrobatic performance by Manager Harrison and pupils, also a May pole dance on skates by 8 ladies and gentlemen, members of the Skating Club. Be sides this there will be skating at intervals as usual. Doors open at 7 p.m. See you get a good seat. In the window of Mr Scaly, tailor, is to be seen a large shaddock, and also some candid peel grown and prepared by Mr Brooker, of Maunu ; and we should judge from appear ance that he is eminently successful. It will be seen that the date of the Church of England social, in aid of the organ fund, has been altered to Monday next, the 30th of September.

Mr Stanford reports : “The returns from Glenrock Company for November show a yield of 377iozs from 460 tons crushed.” The prospects of this mine at present are very bright, and still better returns are expected in the future. We have to congratulate the management on the very satisfactory state of affairs at the mine generally. W hat might have been a serious accident happened while Mr W. T. Smith’s cart was proceeding to Macetown on Tuesday even ing. The river was in a flooded state, and in crossing the cart capised. The driver (M'Keuzie) had to swim fur dear life, while the horse was left floundering in the water. It was with the greatest difficulty that a number of willing hands extricated the animal from its perilous position. When dragged ashore the poor brute was quite exhausted and hardly able to stand. It has, however, quite recovered. No further damage was done. Regarding the town clock for Arrowtown. A letter has been received from Littlejohn and sou, watchmakers, Wellington, stating that the clocks recently received from. Lon don are not suitable tor the requirements of Arrowtown. The firm consider that the clock suitable is a small size turret clock such as they made for Palmerston North. The cost of it would be about L4O. They would take time payment. We consider it about time the committee took some steps in the matter one way or the other. Let us suggest that a band rotunda be erected in a suitable place with the money on hand. The local fire brigade reel has been made quite up to dare by Mr W. Murphy, and a practice will be held on Tuesday evening next. A full attendance of members is re quested.

Wp hear that a little girl, the only daughter of Mr George Shand, au employe at M’Callutn’s sawmill Oteramika (forge, has succumbed to au acute attack of inflammation of the bowels, induced by eating green gooseberries. We can re member, too, a case that occurred at Akaroa some years ago, where three or four chil dren died from eating green peaches.— Wyndham Farmer. We (Otaki Observer) have just hoard of a most pitiable story. It will be remembered that in Mn eh last young Norman M‘Kay. nephew of Messrs Charles and Norman Cuup bell, lost his life by the bursting of the boiler at Mr Campbell’s sawmill at Waikanae. The father of the young man, Mr Duncan M‘Kay, of Waipu, Auckland, arrived at Otaki a fortnight ago to fix a tombstone over the grave of his son. Three days after his arrival he received the distressing news tb <i his little diiugh er, aged fl[r yearn, had died suddenly from diphtheria ; two days later came the news that his wife (a, sister of Messrs C. and N. Campbell) was also dead from the samo complaint, and three days after th.t intelligence cams tnat his second daughter, aged 21 years, had also died fro n the same disoase. Truly in the midst of life we are in death. Great sympathy is felt for Mr M‘Kay, especially as most of his family were in their graves before he could possibly reach home. It is a curious coincidsnce that this is the first time that Mr M'Kay lias been out of the Auckland province for 45 years, he having arrived in Auckland from Ade laide in ilie year 1852. A young New Zealander, who had long loved a girl who lived a mile or two from him, was nearly in despair about winning her hand, ami was on the eve of selling out and leaving the country, as the girl had re fused him three or four times, and it was said that she was engaged to another fellow Our hero had noticed that his rival and the girl would walk in her father’s grass paddock nearly every afternoon, and he grew madly jealous. Among his ca’tle he had a young bull that Was always mad with everything but his master, because he was an especial pet. Now Davie, as he called the bull, was to be the object with which to satide his revenge. He would turn him into the pad dock, hide himself, and see his rival tossed like a football. So one afternoon, calling to Divie, who would follow him lilt i a dog, he repaired to the paddock, let the slip rails down, and turned the bull in. He then strolled off and walked around as miserable as a man could be who was committing an evil deed. Au hour or so later be heard the deep bellowing of the bull, and hastening to the boundary fence, he saw Davie about 20yds from the couple, pawing dirt and shaking his head. The man was trying to gvt the girl to run, bat she was so terrified she could not m vo. The bull made a dash, ami tin; fellow rin shrieking for the fence. Toe bull d ished on after the flying fellow, wil l'our disconsolate young man, having jumped the limes, rushed to the girl as the bull rushed on after the fugitive rival, and catching her in his arms told her that such a coward was u .worthy of her. As Davie saw his young master he left off pursuing the other rmu, returned and began licking his hand, while the indignant girl vowed that she would never more speak to a man that was afraid of a cow.

32,1897-12-02,LCP,Lake County Press,12,IN CASE OF FIRE.,"Your house takes fire. What burns first ? The lightest aud most inflammable stuff, of course —furniture, doors, shelves, floors, panelling, aud other woodwork. If it is a stone or brick house the walls will probably remain standing—a melancholy sight. Were not this a principle of universal ap plication Mr Meddiugs would never have compared himself to a skeleton, as he does iu the letter to which your attention is now invited. ~ T . “ In the autumn of 1891,” ha says, I fell into a low, weak state of health. My ordi nary energy appeared to have gone out of me. I always felt tired and languid, and couldn’t account for it. Nothing seemed to rest me. I was as tired in the morning as when I went to bed. I had a bad taste in the mouth, my appetite was poor, and after meals I had a pain at my chest and left side. “ I was in this condition until the 14th of March. 1892, and then I had to give up work. The reason was, I was too weak to work. In fact, I was so weak that it was about as much as I could do to walk across the floor. Besides this I had a dry hacking cough ; and at night I sweat so the bedclothes wore wet. Sometimes duringtho day cold, clammy s.veats would break out all over mo. “ I lost flesh rapidly, until I was like a skeleton. My muscles seemed to be shrunken and withered. There was no feeling of warmth in me ; it was as though my blood had gone cool and thin. I was too feeble and helpless to wash or dress myself, and people said I was wasting away, as though they ex pected to see the end of it p csently. “ I consulted two doctors and they gave me medicine, but it did me no good. One day my aunt, Mrs Benton, of Francis Street Walsall, called, and in the course of talk she said that the medicine that did her good when she was ill was Mother Seigel’s Cura tive Syrup. Although it didn’t look reason able to believe that it could cure a case as bad as mine, nevertheless my wife got me a bottle from Mr Grove, the chemist in Bark Street, and I commenced taking it. In a few days I found myself much better ; my appetite was better, and I had gained a little strength. “ To make the story short, I kept on tak ing the Syrup and continued to get better. As soon as I could digest my food the night sweats and the cough abated, and iu a few weeks I was able to go back to my work. That is two years aso, and since then I have been in good health for which I have to thank Mother Seigel’s Syrup. (Signed) Arthur Tnomas Meddings, 115, Farringdon Street, Walsall, March 6th, 1894.” In a fire, us we said, it is the light, inflam mable stuff that burns first. That’s why Mr Meddings got to bo so ghastly thin. The flesh or fat is the fuel of the body. In health it keeps up the w rrnth and furnishes the power. A.id to keep up the fuel we must eat. Now, disease is a conflagration ; it tries to burn the house tin, and often dues it. And it always burns the flesh up, more or less of it. The fat goes first, the muscles, etc., afterwai da. That’s the way of it. About that time the tenant mores out. Our friend was well on towards that point. But it wasn’t lung d'saase that ailed him, albeit he had tiic cough and the sweats. They go a'so with indigestion and dyspepsia—his real and only malady. He got feeble and thin because Ins disease wouldn’t allow the stomach to digest food. Hence he consumed all the he had stored up, and then (luckily for him) he began to take Mother Seigcl’s Curative Syrup, which set his stomach and liver right, and give his vic tuals a chance to feed him. All the same, it is dangerous to let a fire get headway.

The soundness of -the-work generally was attested by the fact that the great bulk of the candidates gained over 60 per cent of marks. —The re port was received and adopted and a resolution passed allotting the scholarships as indicated.

The scholarships current absorbed £290; scholarships allocated this year, £145; expenses of examination, £22 Is 2d ; leaving £97 18s 6d avail able for additional scholarships.— After some diseussion as to the pro portion which should be allotied to town and country pupils, on the motion of Mr Baid, seconded by Mr Froggatt, it was resolved to give two additional scholarships of £35 each, tenable for one year, to Cyril T Wild, of Oraki (High School) 72, and Mary M Biggar, of Croydon, 71*1 ; and one scholarship of £2O, tenable for one year, to James G McKay (Invercar gill South school), 78'8. A communication, forwarded by direction of Archbishop Redwood and Bishops Moran (Dunedin), Luck (Auckland), and Grimes (Christ church), requesting the Board to ' direct the examination of the Catholic schools within the district by the Board’s inspectors, was read. —Mr Bain moved, and Mr Baldey seconded that the request be referred to the Executive Committee for considera tion.—Mr Lumsden moved, and Mr McLeod seconded, an amendment that the request be complied with if the inspectors coaid find time to over-” take the work. Considerable dis cussion ensued, in which the chair man recommended thstt the request be granted an a large and influential section of the community were under a disadvantage, especially in Civil service examinations. — Mr McNab favoured the amendment, not for the consideration mentioned by the chair man, but because the applicants were within their rights as defined by the Act, and the Board was a statutory ‘ body.—Mr Baldey thought there was no harm in leaving the matter to the Executive Committee, when the in spectors could be consulted as to whether they would be able to under take the work.—Mr Froggatt held that the applicants were entitled to have their request granted under section 98 of the Education Act.—Mr Bain thought the Board ought to pause before committing themselves to the course suggested. No capita tion was received from the Govern ment in respect of the children at tending Catholic schools, and the Board could not afford to employ a third inspector to do this extra work. —On being put the amendment was carried. The inspectors were granted a month’s holiday annually at alternate times, and the same concession was extended to the secretary and clerk. The Executive Committee reported? (X) That the following tenders had jHKjjften accepted : —Clifden new school, residence, A. Nison, £93.

I think Pahia has settled down quietly after the little stir and bustle which comes even to the quietest corner with the coming of the year, and already we feget to wish those we meet a “ Happy New Year.” Work goes on in the old way once more, while some feel refreshed by the slight break in the round of daily toil, and others are weary with the excitement and fatigue of the few holidays. Some time ago, Mr W Riddle, a settler in this district, lost a fine little mare under rather peculiar circumstances. His son was returning from Orepnki with the milk cart, and as he neared the too of a rise in the road, ho encountered a covered-in waggon ette, which so frightened the mare that she ran backwards, sending the cart with a considerable jar against the bank at the side of the cutting. Little or nothing was thought of it at the time, but two days after the beast went down, having lost the power of her bind legs, and died in a few days. It was supposed that the soine bad been injured, and as the animal was a late pur chase, much sympathy was felt for the owner by many of the people around, es pecially as Mr Riddle had undergone a long and hard strugg : e with adverse wind and' tide. This sympathy they showed by re placing the horse, or, rather, by putting the means to do so in his hand.' It is needless to say the kind deed was appreciated to the full.

In the absence of fire brigade and tho necessary appliances for overcoming fire, the flames extended considei-ably, although Mr John Mitchell aud others did all that was possible under tho disadvantages referre I to. Efforts were chiefly directed to saving the extensive stock of Messrs Forsyth and Masters, and this was accomplished by the demolition of buildings and a small supply of water.

The building destroyed by fire are: —Smith, hairdresser; Larkin, boot maker , Corbett, baker ; Richardson, tailor; Mrs Williams, fruiterer; and (partially puded down) O'Connell, bootmaker. We believe that Messrs Forsyth aud Masters only are insured."" Surely this news was of sufficient interest to form the subject of a press telegram.

It started in Corbet's, the baker's, bedroom, and in about twenty minutes seven houses were destroyed.

93,1895-01-16,WSTAR,Western Star,8,FARMS AND FARMERS.,"EOTHIEMHBCHH3 New Zealand is a country whose prosperity depends upon the success of its farms, and it has been well said “ that there is no part of the British dominions where agriculture, in its widest sense, can be carried on with so maich certainty, and with such good results as in New Zealand,"" provided always that the Government interest themselves to the extent of seeing that our products ate placed Upon th» European markets in such a way as to promote a demand and command re munerative prices. If anyone should doubt the statement that the farmer % is the chief man- in the country, a glance at the Agricultural Statistics in the Tear Book will dispel any scepticism. Out of a total of £9,984,290 representing the whole of the past year’s exports, no less than £5,261,248, or nearly 59 per cent, were due to sheep farming alone. Such being the case the farmer, the producer of this wealth, is always interesting. The glory of the farmer is that in the division of labor, it is his part to create. All trade at last rests on his primitive activity, Emerson has well said “ the first farmer was the first man, and all historic nobility rests on possession and use of the land. Men do not like bard worb’,but every man has an exceptional respect for tillage, and a feeling that this is the original calling of his race, and that he himself is only excused from it by some circumstances which made him delegate it for a time to other hands.” The farmer represents the necessities. He bends to the order of the seasons, the weather, the soils, and the crops, as the sails of a ship bend to the wind. He represents continuous hard Lbour, year in and year out, and, small gains. The farmers are the pioneers of ihe country. They it was who felled bush, drained swamps, cufc. roads, and turned wilderness into spots of beauty, not scheming specu lators nor soldiers, nor professors. To day we in Southland have to thank these long win ied, deep-chested, tough, alow and sure men for what they have done. Many have passed away, but there are hundreds still left, and if they have won a competence they richly deserved it. Scattered about this district aro many men who hare homo the burden and heat of the Lang Syne, and nothing affords us i greater pleasure than a look at their 1 farms and a chat about things in 1 general. Being oat for a day we ; dropped in for a few minutes to see Mr John Mclntyre, of Rothie murclma, the name of his farm, 1 which is situated about sis miles from Thornbury. The homestead is reached by driving along the Lime i stone Plains road, and branching off in a southerly direction near the school house, the road leading direct to Rothiemurchus being very steep at the northern end- The property is t located in the midst of some ■ of the finest agricultural country | one could desire to have, anct is conveniently near to the Night ,ca|>B liue_ and also the Riverton- Envercargill railway. The estate is not excessively large, comprising, some , 1200 acres, and near the Plains road, ; is slightly hilly, the gentle declivities being covered with'rich pastures. To the south is the famed Jacob’s River valley, through which meanders the stream of that name. In this valley in the sixties, Mr Mclntyre first took up his residence, but floods warned him that he would have to seek higher ground. Conversing about this, he re-called the flood of tho sixties, when the water extended from ridge to ridge. But to look at the valley now, with its splendid crops, and picturesque bashes, one would hardly think of floods. Of .recent years, like all other farmers, Mr Mclntyre has gone in largely for sheep, having at the present time be tween two and three thousand, prin cipally crossbred, of excellent quality. The prospect for sheep with t he rulin"" rates is not very cheering but as affording a ray of hope we may mention that Nelson Bros, intend giving only £d lower than their ruling prices in Dunedin last year. We hope at anyrate that the fall will not be lower than that, and that in the near future the tendency will bo up ward. The horses we saw are used for farm purposes, and they were all of a good serviceable stamp. His catlle are chiefly shorthorns, and his bull has an unbeaten record. In the prize ring Mr Mclntyre was always successful in all classes of stock, and has proved Himself a thoroughly prac ticol farmer. He has not gone in largely for crop, bnfr we saw some fins oats, of which there are 300 acres, and some well forward neeps covermatt| a like area. After a walk found theVj fields,""we repaired to the orchard ad- joining the residence. It is a large one, and contains apple and plum trees of great size. This year the apple trees are affected with a blight or fungus. It appears on the fruit Tin the shape of a black soot-like spot; and very soon the apples wither and drop off, the leaves at the same time taking a burnt up appearance. Mr Blackmore, the government pomolo fiist, inpected the orchard when down this way, and recommended spraying We may state that on Monday we visited a garden further up -country and found that the blight had in- ‘ fected the rose trees there. In an swer to an enquiry respecting treat ment, we vrere informed that a mixture of black soap and sulphur was a good remedy as well a preventive, and it might be tried. Of Mr Mclntyre himself we need hardly speak. He is one of our representative farmers. ' Having taken up land as far back as 1863, be has grown with the district, an I has always identified himself with all movements calculated to be for its Mfilfci’e, He has long been an active member of the W.D.A. and P. As sociation, and has occupied the hi»hes|} post in that important body, many years be took a keen interest in County affairs, and was successively councillor and county chairman, a position he filled with credit, and has likewise been a representative on the Hospital Trust. At the present time he is a member of the Southland Land Beard, which has now a lot of work to do. While strictly a farmer, he has assisted with others to develop our mineral resources, but be has not found it by any means a paying thing., Late in the evening we left Rothie murchus, after having enjoyed M> Mclntyre’s hospitality, well pleased with our very short visit.",0.0,2.771837391159455e-07,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/western-star/1895/01/16

A boy named Lyall was hurt by a horse and an evening paper s'ated that be was dead, and that an inquest would be held. The two morning' papers copied the statement with sliyhr, embellishments and reflections. The police reported the death to the Coroner, who at once summoned a jury to attend and hold an inquest at 2 o'clock. The Coroner, Dr Johnston, was proceeding to the place appointed for the hearing of this case, and on his way he met a friend, between whom and himself the following conversation took place: — "" I am going to hold an inquest,"" said the doctor, ""on that po.;r boy who was kicked by a horse."" "" But ho is not dead,"" said the friend, ' Pooh, nonsense !' said, the doctor. But it is a fact,"" replied the friend ; ""Dr Harding told me oxly a minute ago that he was alive and doing well."" "" But good heavens,"" shrieked the the doctor, "" the jurymen are all there waiting at this moment."" "" Well then doctor,"" responded his friend, ""you'll have to find 'em another body, that's all.

Mr Patten, the officer in charge, concludes as follows : "" Reviewing tbii whole circumstances in connection Vvith the settlement, I think the result will not be found un favorable. For instance, a number of families have been permanently se'tled there. Overland communication has Ijeen opened tip with Otago; cattle runs have been taken up, and stock brought over to sappy the market ; a sawmill has been erected which finds employment for tvventy uun; cattle breeding, model farming, and seal fish ing are also carried on ; and lastly from the Bay prospecting parties have been fitted oat, and started to explore the coast, which were the means of discovering tho copper mine in Dusky Sound, and a marble quarry in Caswell Sound. Of the future settlement of this portion of the Middle Island, I think thc.'O need be no cause for apprehension."" The Wellington Chronicle remarks that the tryauny of the Judges ia about to bo put in the shade by the ungallant despotism of tho Colonial Treasurer, who has apparently formed the fiendish design of depriving our city belles of the pleasure, of limping about in high heeled boots.

The yellow metal is being as eagerly sought as of yore, and, if we can credit the Otago Witness, Cardrona is with in measureable distance of a boom. ‘ Seeing is believing ’ say the sceptics ; meanwhile “ hard graft ” for a good wash-up at Christinas is the order of the day. In matters cricketerial (if I may coin a word) there is a little to chronicle. Both the school team and the C.C.C. have played matches scoring wins and lossesj especially the latter The schoolboys have played the Arrow hopefuls twice, and each time they made a sturdy effort against superior age and strength, obtained a slight lead in the first innings, but were doomed to disappointment in the second. These contests must commend them selves to all who wish to see cricket prosper in our midst; for it is to the youngsters we must look for our future first elevens, and surely the best way to train up cricketers is to commence with the raw material at an early age. But this is rambling. Last Saturday our neighbours from the Lakeside Academy returned our visit, but the weather ! Words fail me at this point. It lightened, it thundered, it blew and it rained with such particular cussed ness and persistence that even the boys cried a ‘go’ and the match was post poned to a more convenient date. The seniors of Pembroke and Cardrona have tried conclusions twice, and honors have been equally distributed. Both matches were conspicuous for the smallness of the scores, the moun tain air (and 'the pitches, perhaps) appearing to be better suited to the development of bowling, than of batting talent. The first match was played at Pembroke, and has already received publicity in your columns. At Car drona on the 20th the tables were turned on the Lakeites, the home team winning by 19 runs on the first innings. Cardrona batted first, but misfortune soon overtook them, and when the first five wickets had fallen for the dreaded “ duck’s egg,” things looked decidedly bad. However J. Cullen (18), O’Hara (10), and Tracey (11) stemmed the tide of disaster, and the innings produced 50 runs. 0. Ironside (6 wickets for 23) and M'Skim mings (4 wickets for 24) were the only bowlers tried. 0. Ewing, who made 15 by patient cricket, was the only Pembrokite to reach double figures, , the bowling of Patterson (3 wickets for 7) and Lafrauchi (7 wickets for 18) not allowing many liberties, and the innings closed for 31 runs. Cardrona had lost one wicket in the second innings and O’Hara (IS) and Cullen (22) were batting vigorously when rain put a stop to the play. Messrs Halliday and Stewart gave every satisfaction as umpires. The next match is against Arrow, and, as we have now a good matting wicket, we hope to see some good batting on that occasion. Meantime my advice to our boys is to practise, practise, practise.",0.0,1.3546396330910432e-07,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/lake-county-press/1897/12/02

40,1878-10-22,WEST,Westport Times,7,"The Westport Times. TUESDAY, OCTOBER, 22, 1878.","Tub New Zealander makes a specialty of condemning Special Settlements. Karamea and Jackson's Bay offer a piece cle resistance on which our con temporary periodically cuts and comes again. Unfortunately in exposing the defects of management of these settle ments, and the almost wilful waste of money, it gives no credit to the settlers themselves for either honesty, good intent, or the ability to work out their own redemption, as strangers in a strange laud. Like the Northern Farmer our contemporary desires the public, in respect to the inhabitants of these special settlements to take its word for it '• The poor in a loornp be bad.'' In the issue of the 16th inst. the New Zealander writes thus :— ""It is not our present purpose to take exception to the appointment of Dr Giles, for possibly if an inquiry is really necessary no more able nor impartial man coulcl be found to conduct it, but j rather to point out and prove if possible that the investigation can only leave matters as they stand at present : that the course pursued is in fact neither more nor less than shelving a disagree able duty which is to decide as to the best way to rid the country of an incubus and close up a wretchedly absurd piece of experimental legislation that has been incontestibly proved a costly failure. At different times during the past few months the subject has been alluded to, but its importance quite warrants our re verting to it as occasion .serves, for the simple reason that the maintenance of tliesespecial settlers and their keepers is a serious charge upon tho revenue of the country,a charge that the bread-winner is I called upon to pay, but ono that he has an undoubted right to protest against I as uncalled for and unjust. In prin ciplo this system of founding hotbeds for the forcing of colonists is bad, inso much that it is detrimental to the development of the essential facilities of tha true colonist—self help and self reliance. The badness of the principle in the instances of the Karamea aud Jackson's Bay Settlements has not in the least degree been ameliorated by the practice, for judged by results, worse-managed enterprises would in>. deed be difficult to discover. The affairs of the former place have already been passed in brief review. There the expenditure of thousands of pounds of borrowed money has been successful only in providing a snug estate for the stewards into whose hands the direction of affair was entrusted, and a careful perusal of the last annual report of the Jackson's Bay Settlement shows a state of things that is really no improvement upon those mad# manifest in respect to its northern congener."" In proof of this tho New Zealander adduces figures to show that the country has spent sixty five pounds each for every man, woman, and child on the Jackson's Bay Settle ment "" to enable them to live in a coun try where every man willing to work can earn a comfortable livelihood from the hour he lands."" Arguing on this point, and also on the fact that the Resident Agent at Jackson's Bay has had to complain of the very indifferent raw material he has had to deal with, and that amongst settlers there exists a feeling of discontent, and a desire to make things as unpleasant as possible, and that the same state of affairs exists, or has existed, at the Karamea, our con temporary first expresses suspicion that "" resident agents and directors are either men of remarkably dull preceptive facaltiei, or else that they are discreet enough to bo blind to faults, while settlers contribute to their (the agents') benefit by keeping them in snug sine curiS,""andlhen propounds this proposal : "" Let these settlers leave, if they choose for good, ihe good thnt evidently they cannot gain by staying ; but if, on the other hand, they prefer to stay, let them support themselves as the independent immigrant does, and has done since the foundation of the Colony. Tho hard working man has no business to he taxed to support in comparative idle— ncss a fellow laborer, whose exaggerated notious of what the Government are bound to do for him, is only equalled by his through urisuiUbleness for tho task for which he has been specially chosen."" It is in this respect our contemporary warders wide of the mark, aud dis plays a peculiar pertinacity of adverse opinion against special settlers, not warranted by any knowledge of actual .''acts. These settlers, at lea it we write of what we know and have seen at the Karamea, are no idlers, their notions of what the G-overnment are bound to do for them are not exag gerated, and they are not unsuitable for the task of pioneer settlement. In a word they are very reverse of this. From Karamea the Resident Agent has departed, His fellow official at Jackson's Bay should also receive his conge, but there is room enough, work enough and need enough, for every hard working settler that can bo induced to remain. The inducement needed — we speak now of the Karamea—is merely that which members in the House aud a large section of the colonial press constantly clamor for on behalf of remote and comparatively inaccessible districts, special money grants or special facilities for opening up new, or improving existing tracks, whereby ihe settlers can bring their produce to market. It is but an item in the details of developing tho re sources of the country that is asked for, and needs neither special leg:sla« tion or special comment, much the less should any comment bear in tho eo persistently insisted on oy our Wellington contemporary. A few of tho many thousands of pounds sterling annually lavished on unpro ductive schemes and superfluities by the New Zealand Government, would develope both the Karamea and Jackson's Bay into flourishing districts, and gradually recoup the colony the thousands of pounds spent on the experiment of establishing special settlements.",0.0,8.226680236503765e-08,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/westport-times/1878/10/22

Bourdeau and Party wrote asking the Council to give assistance in mak ing a road from opposite Criterion Creek, Shotover river. It would also be the means of opening up the river.

Baird and Elliot wrote asking that a certain road-line be closed at Millers Flat. It was of no use, and would never be required. They were willing to pay all expenses, such as advertis ing, etc. It was resolved that the request be acceded to, and the County take the necessary steps. J.

It was decided that the Board be again written to, and an appeal be made to the Colonial Secretary for justice. A. M ! Caughaa wrote saying he had sold his interests in the tail-race across the County road between the Five and Seven-mile, to E. A. Cameron, and wished to transfer the responsi bility to the latter, who had purchased the same.—Transferred accordingly. R. Bouchier, secretary of The Home, Invercargill, wrote (in reply) stating that the following resolution had been passed at the meeting of the Board : —That the letter of the Clerk of Lake County Council be received and he be informed that the Secretary has more important work to attend to, and he be referred to Mr St Omer, member of the Board, for any further information he may desire.

Mr Fraser wished to know how much the Council could give to wards the £I7OO for Skippers Bridge as it would be very hard to get the whole amount. On the suggestion of Or Rogers it was decided to wire Mr Fraser asking if a petition for the Skippers Bridge would strengthen his hands. If so, Cr Rogers would get up a petition. The Minister of Mines also wrote saving that with regard to the request for a further amount of £6OO for the Arrow-Macetown road, a sum of £250 would be proposed in the estimates. After that the Council would have to nrovido any further suras required.— Received.

49,1878-10-22,WEST,Westport Times,16,BROADBRIM'S LETTER,"FEOM PAULS.-No. 15. One of the moat peculiar features of this Exposition is that just about I'm time you imagine you have explored its wonders pretty thoroughly, you sud denly come upon a section that you liaye never seen or hoard of before, arid wonder how it could possibly have es caped you. I commenced my tour of inspection on the first day of May. In fact, I was pretty familiar with the building some weeks before that, and yet, during the past week, I have seen things which have lilled mo with wonder to think that I could have wandered about through this Exposition and never have seen them before. As you cross the magnificent bridge which spans the Seine between the Trocadoro and the main building, a number of beautiful structures lie immedia-ely to the right The little Principality of Mcuiac > has raised an elegant little Oriental kiosk and filled it with ceramics and curious objects of arfc. You will doubtless recollect; that it was to this place the gamblers went when they were banished from JJadcri- Baden, and to day it is the great gambling houseof Europe. When I first heard of the iMonnco exhibit, I expected to find faro boxes, packs of cards, sweat cloths, roulette tables, dice boxes ; and you may guess my surprise to discover one of the most beautiful exhibitions of ceramics in the entire Exposition, surrounding fountains and floweis, and other object of beauty and art. Beyond the exhibit of Monaco, is a special exhibit by Spain, and just here let me say that Spain has made a magnificent display in a number of other departments Tho building of which I sni now going to speak is the Spanish exhibit of wines, and remark able as it m;iy seem, is composed ex clusively of bottles. l'he building is quite largo and imposing, only a little distance off a party of wild Arabs fresh from the desert sands l:iy easily about beneath the shadow of their tents, and looking as we imagine Ishmael must havo looked, the first born of Abraham. Entering the door at once you are dazzled by a scene of Oriental splendor, gorgeous pillars of glass and arches of clnyslal rise before you, dishing and glitLering with millions of colored lights The arches and pillars are modelled I after tilt! grand palace of flu: Alliambra. You turn to the right or the loft and, multiplied by the chrystal iv/loctw: s, yon look through long- avenues of beautitul arches wtiere the light, multiplied a thousand times, flushes and breaks ia diamond coruscations till yon leol that yon are standing in fairy land Ovpr your head hang multitudes of glittering stalactites of the purest whi'e, of the brightest of chrystal and of the moat emerald green; purple yellow, violet and multi -tides of shades for which art has not yet found a name, add to the wonders of 'his enchanting pnlaoe, Yon hive been inspecting this marvell ous building some time before you begin to realize that you have only been lookitg at botiles. Pillars of wine, roof of wine, walls of wine and floor of wine, —wine, wine, wine, everywhere : Hoclc, sherry, champagne, Port and Xeres de la Prontara, the wine of the city of Paradise. As a specimen of architectural genius it has excited general wonder, an 1 even among this assemblage of works gathered from every portion of (he globe, this unique exhibition of Spanisn wines has been conside-ed one of the marvels of the Exposition. In the United States department, almost hidden by displays of shining teeth and templing jewelry, paper fashions, patent tins ami model post ollices, is a little case which you might pa«s unnoticed, and yet which deserves something more than a passing men- tion. As an exhibit it is insignificant and small. It came so late that it has not even earned a jdace on the catalogue, and yet small as it. is, it demonstrates a principle which is destined to do for the Southern States of the United States of North America, what, the prophet of old did for tho captive Jews when tie led them out of the bouse of bondage. This little caso was brought on by 001. E. Richardson, the great cotton, planter of Mississippi, and is the product ol his mills at Wesson, one hundred and forty-five miles above .New Orleans. It looks hopeful for thb South when in a little out of thewwa r place like Wesson, where twenty years, ago not a man in a thousand could have told what a spindle was when he saw it j that a factory should rise running IIjOOO spindles, employing 550 hands, consuming' 5,000 bales of cotton, a half million of pounds of woo!, and producing fabrics sold at their own door worth three quarters cf a million annually. The fabrics produced are principally those worn by the people of the South, and are evidently made to last. This enterprise, besides furnishing work for thousands of perple who would ba otherwise un employed, has been one of' tho best investments for capital, it profi s being from ten to fifteen per cent. Diy by day this wealthy cotton planter, whose cop last year was nino thousand bales, may be seen examining the various classes of goods and we may reason ably expect that in a year or two, at farthest, the latest Parisian styles will be transported to the bank Mississippi, where directed by the genius of W"". Oliver they may be dispensed to the people of the United States. The other day I thought I would make a visit to the salt water Aquar ium. For I must tell you that it has been a favorite project with the designers of this Exposition to famil iarize the public with the habits of salt water fish. On a former voyage to Cape Horn I was fed on salt cod for a period of five weeks, and I was anxious to know the habits of the fish, That he should be exceedingly sail did not astonish me, seeing that he had always lived in salt water; but I was anxious to know what ho eat and where he roosted, aud what made him so exceedingly salt about the tad. The French Exposition was my golden opportunity and I reso'ved to embrace it ; besides 1 had louged to catch a whale and there were to be several here on exhibition, — the opportunity looked favorable and last week I started out The thermometer stood something below a hundred, but cheered by the fact that I should have tho Aquarium all to myself, I asked the 0 flic or 011 guard to direct me. It ran something like this: —"" Prenez a gouehe, allous, aivetez une soco/ido; a droite; tournez, allous, allous, allous."" Straight as a string, 1 said, L'il go it and off 1 started. I doubled, I twisted, I went to the right and the left, enquiring of every one the way to the salt water aquarium, t did not care about sharks, porpoises and such small deer. I wanted to catch a whale 1. thought while the attention of the '' gendarmes"" W as diverted tlu't i mjght slip one out in my vest pocket. 1 noticed a sort of pitying smile on the face of every person of wnoin I inquired. I did not know the reason at tho time, but after two hours' search under a broiling July sun, I discovered that the last mackerel had died of galloping consumption about two weeks before, and eighteen empty tanks were all that remained of the salt water Aquarium. Yours truly, Broadtsium'.",0.0,5.2175816993154116e-08,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/westport-times/1878/10/22
90,1895-01-16,WSTAR,Western Star,5,WALLACE COUNTY COUNCIL,"Saturday, January 12th. The monthly meeting was attended bv the Clm’i mao, J. 0. Ellis, Esq , and Crs Hamilton, Newton, Grant, Hirst, Ba-rstian, and Car michael. j The Land Depirtment wrote in reply to a communication stating that the Board bad approved of the Council’s proposal to expend the thirds on section 61, Wairaki, in accord ance with Mr McLean’s request.—Received. The Chief Surveyor wrote stating that the acreement with respect to the expenditure of £l5O on Grassy Creek road was now ready for signature.—Ordered to be signed. G. C. Tothill, Invercargill, wrote calling attention to a letter regarding the Californian thistle which had appeard in the Press, and requested the Council to adopt means to eradicate it along County roads. Cr Hamil ton said he found it the thistle was cut down before it came to bloom it would die out. Or Carmichael said they should be out in the paddocks, and he pointed out that it would have been well had the writer started at home as th® town of Invercargill was full of them. Cr Newton was of opinion that the Council should set the example by eradicating it from their properly. It was a serious pest, and if, as Cr Ham Ron remarked, cutting it down before it bloomed would stop it, then all settlers should adopt this simple means. Cr Hamilton moved that the surfacemen bo in structed to out the thistle down on all Conuty roads. Seconded by Or Newton. Cr Hirst said the motion would necessitate his surface man travelling maoy miles to cut down a patch which- was at the Waiau. Mr D. Corkery lived in the vicinity, and he thought the Council should get him to do it. Cr Grant said there were patches of the thistle near Ringway, and at Mararoa, between the Key of the Lakes and Plains Station. The places where they existed should be pointed out to the surfacemen. Tho Chairman said there was no legislation in force to compel settlers to out the thistle, and rather than legislate specially for this pest, tho Govern moot preferred to legis'ate in the direction of lessening tho evi s from ell noxious weeds, ft bad been mentioned at the Chamber of Commerce that next session it weald be at tended to. Or Carraichat 1 said there was a bie pilch near the embankment on the Fairfax foid. He thought Mr TothilTs hand should be strengthened. They wanted legislation for the Californian thistle alone, and they could assist by memorialising the Minister of Lands. The motion was carried. On the suggestion of Cr Newton it was de oidec to inform Mr Tothill that the Council were taking the necessary stops. Constable Fretwell, inspector under the Factories Act, wrote re meeting of delegates to meet for fixing the statutory half-holiday The Clerk pointed out that the Act did not provide for fixing the day outside boroughs and town districts, where any day could be fixed.—Received. P Sheridan, Gropers Bush, wrote re questing the Council to expend £lO of thirds in making the road to section 7, block 16, Longwood, viable. To be in formed that tho matter will be attended to. W Mackintosh, Dunrobin, wrote in reference to an impassable road to section 6, block 14, Centre Hiil Cr Basstian said the writer had just taken up tho section, and he suggested that the Engineer should report, A motion to that effect was carried. Mrs C Letcher, Drummond, wrote stating she had no road to section 201, and if the Council would purchase half the land from the Ringway estate for tho purpose, she would buy the other half. Cr Carmichael pointed out that Mrs Letcher had taken up tho land with the fu'l knowledge of its re quirements. The applicant’s rates wore small, and seeing that a five-pound note was refused to settlers who had been 20 years in the district, he did not think they could make any exception.—Letter reoeived. Morgan Hayes, Riverton, wrote stating chat he had received a lawyer’s letter for bidding him from going backward and for ward to his farm at Longwood, and he asked the Council to protect him. The Engineer explained that Mr Hayes had property on the north of the Pourakino bridge. He crossed the bridge and to get to it had to go through property belonging to Mr L W Petchell. There was no Govern ment road except the chain reserve on the hanks of the Pourakino, Sometime ago, Mr Lopdell, who was a tenant of Mr Hayes’s, got permission from tho Council to put a gate on the Pourakino bridge, he in return allow ing the Council to use a track logo to the Longwood, which saved expense. Since then Hayes and Lopdell had had some trouble, leading to strained relations, and Mr Hayes had received notice not to go through the track any more. If the Council were disposed to do anything, he (the engineer) would suggest that the chain reserve be made a road. Tho Engineer was instructed to inspect and report. Cr Hamilton said the Wild Bush road had been brought undpr his notice, and Mr Murchison, who was present, had informed him that he would do the work, some 80 yards, and wait for payment for 13 months. He and Cr Hare had come to the decision that the offer should be accepted, and Cr Hamilton moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, in order to get the vote sanctioned. The motion was lost. An agreement with tho National Bank with respect to financial matters affecting tbo County was ordered to bo signed. Cr Hirst presented a petition from 14 settlers at Oraki repeating an offensive drain in front of sections 21,22, 23, and 21, which was likely to be productive of serious diseases. Cr Hirst pointoi out that the local body was the b ard of health, and it was theit duty to get rid of this nuLacce. la the interests of the settie-s he moved that the Engineer inspect and report on .the best method of altering the drain.—Carried. Or Hirst presented another petition signed by 11 settlers in bLck 11, Longwood, who were milk suppliers to the Orepuki dairy factory, requesting the Council to consider the advisability of at once gravelling the cuttings and embankments near Mr Fitz gerald’s on the Orepuki-Waiau road. —On the motion of Or Hirst it was decided to call for tenders for gravelling, payment for the work to stand over for 13 months, tenders to bo opened at the next meeting. Accounts amounting to £632 ware passed for payment. Cr Basatian said it seemed a large amount considering the atan 1 they had taken to retrench. Or Hirst said the larger part was deferred payment money, which of course had to be spent. Ho would mention that the Council’s overdraft was lower now than it had been for months which showed that ibei • rftrenohnjent had been to an extent effective. Regarding an exchange of roads, in Heddon Bush district, the Clerk stated no objections had bo°n lodged, and it was decided to take the final steps. Cr Hirst moved that the usual steps he taken under the Public Works Act to acquire land from Lindsav’s to Oreii flat for road purposes.—Carried. Cr Mitchell was granted two months leave of absence. Or Carmichael said that a sum of £lO expended in Aparirpa Riding had been charged to Otautau, and he moved for a return to bo la’d on the table showing all the moneys paid by Otautau for work in the Aparima Riding. Or Grant said ho noticed in looking over the d.p. aed 0.1. moneys there was only a sum of £7 12s Gd put down to the credit of seation 76, Wairaki, when there should be £32 17s 6d. Op the motion of Or Newton, it was decided to write to tbp chief commis sioner calling his attention to the discrep ancy. The dog tax was fixed at tha same sum as that of last year. The Chairrpui stated that there was a Government vote of £3OO for expenditure either to deviate the Gorge road on t> the Waiau Plat or open a new one, and as he did not wish to see the vote lapse, be asked for power to forward the expenditure. This was granted, and a committee appointed to consider the best means of spending the money most advantageously. Or Carmichael suggested that the Engineer should jaret pome assistance to enable him to pet various road woiks in Bayswater under way, bus no action was taken. The Engineeers report was read. Grassy Creek Road.— Shortly after last meeting 1 went to Grassy Creek as m etructed. Mr Newton, the member for Wairio Riding also visited the locality and in-pecled the routes proposed. I reported to the County Chairman ns follows: “ I have been over the route for road pro posed by Mr Hare and Mr McKenzie along east side of the creek, and consider it practicable. Its advantages are that the ti le cuttings, which will be about 48 or 50 chains long, are in gravelly ground, so that when made, the road will be solid and not cut up so readily as on the west side; and though Ido not think it quda so good a route as the latter, it can be made available for present traffic for less money, as thq deviation can be cut shorter in the mean time. Its principal disadvantages are that it is on the shady side of the valley, and that it ends below the bridge over Grassy Creek, where there is frequently a bad ’over flow in flood time. The latter objection may be obviated when the Council is in better financial circumstances, by continuiug the road right along the foot of ihe hills to near the woolshed ; the present suggestion being to go oil the track near the gate at the first angle north of the log for 1 ; bat of course it would bo expensive as there would be more than a mile extra to make of side catting. The present road would be costly to make as it crosses lagoons even now lull of water. I saw Mr Beggs who said ha would not interfere with traffio through his oats until the 26th December (excepting only mobs of cattle horses or shi ep) but unless the Council decided before that date to make the road off the flat, either one side or the oth j r, and close the present road, he would fence it at ones. If the Council did decide to move tho road either to the East terrace or the West, he would I ave. the track open to all traffio except mobs of cattle &o for this season. Under these circumstances under instruc tions from the Chairman, 1 wro e to Mr Beggs on 14th December stating that the road would be removed from the fiat. The length to be made if the tasc side is decided upon will be about 2| miles, a good deal of which will not require farming at present. There will be about 50 chains aide cutting, and 20 chains of very easy side cutting, also about 20 ch.ina very light side cutting and soft ground to deal with, and 3 small bridges to build. The other water courses can be culvei ted. The cost to open road will bo roughly £240 or £250, of which the Government grant will provide £l5O. The new rend will have to be surveyed and taken under the Public Works Act; and the Council should to-day definitely fix route. Ah it will be necessary to camp out to make survey, [ request the Council to give me authority to purchase a tent. It was deoided to open the road on the east side of Grassy Creek, several members expressing the opinion that it would be folly to keep the real on the flat. Authority was given to purchase tent, &o. Main Road Orepnki-Waiau—Bullock drays working on this road are damaging the for mation by locking the hind wheels ani sledg ing down the hills, thus cutting the road up with large ruts. As the hill* were put into good enough order for all ordinary summer traffic, the owners of the drays should be comp lied to hare proper brakes. —R> g irdieg this matter it was decided to advertise warn ing drivers, and also to put notices upon the trees. Road to Hardy’s section No. 31, Block IV, Longwood—l have to report that I at tempted to lay out a road on the lines sug gested by Mr Hardy through section 30, but found I could not do so under the conditions required. The Chief Commissioner proposes to expend £SO in making the read, the Council to lay it out, and the labor to be done by the “ Co-operatives.” I can find no route which can be made practicable for the money. A great part of the line, Which is nearly 70 chains long, is through dense bush, and is in tersected by very s<e*p and very deep gullies, and unless the Council is prepared to sup plement ihe £50,1 think it would bo better for the Government to lay out the road in a manner acceptable to themselves than for the Council to attempt what I fear must turn out unsatisfactory to all concerned. I reported on this road before, and pointed out that it would cost from £3OO to £350 to make a proper dray road. The report was under date 25th September, 1893, and was, E believe forwarded to the Chief Commis sioner.—lt was deoided to inform the Chief Commissioner that the Engineer had been on the ground, and the Council deemed it de sirable that he should undertake the Survey of the road and the expenditure of the money in making a viable track. Grader work on Hundred Line—The part of the Hundred Line at Mr Dawson’s section (No-149) has been formed with the grader full width, for a distance of a little over a mile. The settlers found the horses and Mr Allan Jones worked the machine. The work is in every way satisfactory, the hollows, which necessitated culverts, have in four in stances been filled up and the culverts dis pensed with, and the actual cost to the Council will not much exceed a shilling u chain. Road from Etal Creek to Jacob’s River Ford—ln reply to a suggestion that I should meet their surveyor on the ground with a view of securing a good road away from the Jacob River bank, through Education Endowment, 208 Wairaki, Mr JL McDonald writes that the matter had been considered by the commissioners and that they had re served the rig bt in all their leases to lay of roads wherever required. Bridges—The Otautau bridge is nearly, but not quite finished. The b'idge at Lang ford’s, Tat ingatura block, Wair.o, which the Council authorised me to get rebuilt, but which was put hack by the chairman’s order owing to financial pressure, is unsafe and should be built at once. The small bridge over the Fenbatn at Raymond’s Gap requires renewing ; also two small bridges bridges on back road, Scott’s Gap reported by the surfaceman, and two small bridges near Blackmount which require repairs. I would recommend the Council to buy the timber (totara) offered by Whitting and Co, and stacked at old min, Merrivale, at 8s per 100. Wbitliog and Co. do not require immediate payment. Quantity abiut £2O worth. It was resolved to erect the bridge at Langford’s at once, and adopt the other recommendations of the Engineer in ro ga-d to bridges. Gravel for Maintenance, Main Road be tween Fairfax and Ringway—This road badly requires maintenance. Mr P Sheridan offers to supply gravel and wait for his money until after March.—Held over. Gravel for Wild Bush—This road requires graveling in some hollows between the school and the bush. Mr D Murchison offers Mr Hamilton, member for the riding, to supply 80 cubic yards of Jacob's River gravel at 5s per yard and to wait 12 months for the money. The Council’s co.'cnrrence in the arrangement is required.—Not ac cepted. Creek Diversion and Rea l Formation at section 233, Tariogatura—A contract for the worh has been let, the contractor to make his own arrangement with Mr Plunkett about entering his land, Hoad to Mr James Hay’s along Jacob’s River bank—l have visited this road and re port it in a rough state, ft is almost impass able in wet weather. At the rick yard, about half a mile from the first small bridge, the river is rnnroachiug and has eaten away about 4Gft or 47ft, leaving only about 19 or gift of roadway. Tue bank requires fas oioiqg for about or 2 chains. The road should bo formed will; the grader, about 25 feet wide and taking out the gravellel pieces. There are about 50 chains to form. Mr Hay told me he wou'd pull the grader with his traction engine if the Council found the coal, which would not cost much.—Hel l over. Cr Grant’s motion for tke reduction of members’ travelling expenses by one-holf was 'ost. He bad one on the order paper dealing with a reduction of the clerk’s salarr, Ini withdrew it, he being of opiiiiop that the dart, a good officer, had as much work as he could do. Soveial members expressed them selves in a similar strain, and one remarked that he deserved an increase not a decrease. The motion dealing with holding tho meetings every alternative month was held over. The question of surfacemen’s wages oamo up for discussion, being introduced by Cr Hamilton, who moved that they be paid 6s a day. I n speaking to the motion bo s-aid men could be obtained now for 5s a day, and con sidering the depressed state of things be thought 6s a day was amide. In seconding the motion pro forma , Cr Carmichael said it would only mean a saving of £ 188 a year, and he did not bela ve in making the surface men suffer that loss when it wood neither make nor mar the Council, He woull rote against the motion. Cr B isstian opposed the motion. In his experience he did not think there was any Council paying loss than they were. But apart from that, bad workmen could be got for low wages, while a good wokmen always earned his pay. If they paid their surfacemen 7s they would gat their worth from them. The propose I reduction was a penny wise and pound foolish policy. Ha noticed that in some public bodies there was always a time when someone raised tho cry of “ retren •hment,” and by listening to it very often more mischief than good was done. Cr Newton agreed with Cr Basaiian when ho said he did not believe in reduoiog the surfacemen’s wages. He was satisfied that if the Wairio surfacemen wore reduced, the Council would bo the loosers. After giving reasons for his statement, and in stancing some things to show the value of experienced men to the Council, ho con cluded by expressing the hope that the motion woulk be lost.—The moticn on being put was lost. The Council then adjourned.",0.0,3.9505935718188164e-08,https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/western-star/1895/01/16

The Pope congratulates Cardinal Manning on the success of his ex ertions to bring about a settlement of the strike. The date of Burns' departure for Australia is uncertain. The Lancashire cotton mills will stop work for a fortnight for the purpose of defeating the operations of the ""corner"" in cotton.

So far the elections have resulted in the return of 217 Republican candi dates, while the supporters of other parties have secured 168 seats. There wil be 120 second ballots, and of these it is expected that 89 will be favourable to the Republicans. M M Ferrior, Leonsay, Dereloude, Dillon, Fallieres, Spuller and Cassag nac have beeii elected. M Ferry was defeated. In the case of MM.

The latest returns show that 267 Moderate Republicans, 57 Radicals, 86 Royalists, 51 Bonnpartists, and 22 Boulangists have been elected. In 187 other cases a second ballot will be necessary, and it is expected 135 of these will be favourable to the Government. It is believed the Chamber will eventually consist of 369 Republicans and 201 Opposition of various shades. London, September 24. The Paris correspondent of the Times anticipates that the Republicans will have a majority over all other parties combined of i'rotn 92 to 120.

85,1889-09-28,NA,Northern Advocate,30,WHANGAREI MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT CLASS.,"The Rev. B. Hutson delivered hia lecture on *• Socialism "" on Friday evening last, which was as follows : — Socialism is a word which is used in very different and diverse significations. We have socialism for the poor and socialism for the rich. We have state socialism and socialisms destructive of the state. Christian socialism is common in some quarters, while in others Atheistic socialism is wide spread. To give a precise and concise definition of a wide spread movement, ramifying into every corner and crevice of our complex social life, i 3 a task al most hopeless. Leaving the impracticable if not the impossible for others, I shall content ■ myself with a description rather than a defi nition of socialism. The word socialism was Brar used by the English communists to designate their particu lar form of communism. It is now used to designate any system, which requires that the land and instrument? of production, shall be the property of communities, associations or Gov ernmeuts, and not of individuals. Socialists stillp.ofes3 to adhere to the masim of the com munists, "" There is no difference among man kiprl-but-age and Sox. They 'have all the same faculties and the same wants, and should there fore have the same food and the same edu cation ; "" but they have practically abandoned it. Instead of maintaining ""To each accord ing to his needs "" they now assert that ""To each should belong the full fruit of his labour."" Socialists may be divided into two parties, the revolutionary nod tho law-abiding, or moderate party. Continental socialum cul minating in Nihilism is chii.-iiy revolutionary. English socialism tends to reformation in an orderly manner. One has expressed tho dis tinction by saying, "" The English struggle is about the terms of the contract, the German social warfare is directed against the very existence of one of the two contracting parties."" In England wo have a case for the civil court, on tho continent a case of civil war. When socialism is spoken of many at once identify it with simple communism; and be cause absolute equality is impossible they will not listen to the claims of socialists. Com munism is not true to nature, and unjust to the industrious and the thrifty. If the funde mental maxim of equality of all men is true, then the equal sharing by all is just. But men are not equal, and socialists have been com pelled to admit it. "" The distinctive feature of socialism is not that all things are in common, but that production is only carried on upon the common account, and that the instruments of production are held as common property. The characteristic of socialism is the joint owner ship by all the members ot the community of the instruments and means of production, which carries with it the consequence that tho division of the produce among the body of owners must be a public act performed according to rules laid down by the community."" J. S. Mills. It is considered to bo fudemontal to con temporary socialism that ""To each should be long the full fruit of his labour."" There' is' nothing terrible in such a proposition, nothing indicative of a revolution in countries where the recognised rule is. "" A fair day's work for a fair day's wage."" If we yield ourselves to the guidance of Marx, Lassalle, Hyndman and others, and allow them ' to show to us the irregualities arising, so they say, from our present industrial system, the effects 'of the tyranny of capita^ and the relentless iron law of wages, we gradually become conscious of a difficulty in adjusting matters, and a fear that their millennium is on the other side of a sea of blood. Even though tho present social state be as bad as socialists represent it to be, it is by . no means certain that it is wholly caused by our industrial system and it is far from being clear to many minds that it would be improved under the new order of things. History teaches that reformation is better than revolution in helping in the progress of humanity. We may describe socialism as a vast move ment now going on among the more advanced nations of the world, whereby men hope to bring about, fry fair moans or by foul, a more equal distribution of wealth and the comforts of life. SOCIALISM OF THE PAST. Socialism is not a product of the nineteenth century. We cannot trace it beyond the flood, but we have indications of a state of society like unto ours at the building of the tower of Babel, and it is quite possible that the socialists weie about in those days. The patriarchal age was on the lines of socialism. They had all things in common. All primitive history points to a state of society where all things are held more or less in common by the tribe. For the real origin of socialism as a system, and as it is proclaimed by modern advocates, we must go to the great law-giver Moses. He may havo got his ideas from the Egyptians, or there may have been something in the constitution of the Egyptian state in the way of monopoly, that induced him to legislate as he did in regard to the land and common interest of Israel. There may be a difference of opinion as to where Moses got his ideas from, but there can be none in regard to the origin of modern social ism. As a proof it may be said that the most perfect society of socalists that has yet existed reckoned Moses their legislator, and also that Jews have been principal leaders in modern socialism. The society to which we refer is tho sect of THE ESSENES. They existed and nourished about the time of Christ, and some have even ventured the suggestion that John the Baptist, if not Jesus t Christ hiniself, belonged to the sect. Josephua gives a detailed account of them. He says, "" What they most of all honour, after God himself, is the name of their legislator (Moses) who.n if anyone blaspheme, ho is punished capitally."" These are Jews by birth, and are despisers of riches, and so very communicative as raises our admiration. Nor is there any found among them who ' hath more than another : for it is a law among them, that those who c«ni!e to them must let what they have be oroino:! to the whole order, inasmuch that anonjr them all there is no appearance oi poverty or excess of riches, but everyone's possessions nre intermingled witli every other's possessions; and so there is, as it wer**. one patrimony amoujr all the. brethren."" "" They aVoluivc RlewnWs .appointed to take care of their common affairs, -who every one of them have no stjvirfite business for any. but wh.-i"" is for the use of them all.""

If we compare this ancient sect with the requirements of many socialists we may be led to think that their purpose may be achieved for what has been established among men may be again. THE CHRISTIANS come next in order of time. In Acts 2. 41-4"" we iuid ih<* early Christians founding a r0r..~ misnwMt- ff-i-i.^v. "" All that believed were tojether. and had all things common, anr sold then* rosse.ssions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."" Also chapter 4 : 3*2. 33, and 34 verse. •• And the multitude of them that believed were of one hmrt and one sonl ; neither said any of their that atiybt of the things which he possessed was his «.-wn. r>n f they had all thing 9 common ""Neither vths t/i-ro any among them that lacked, for as many ns were possessors of lands or houses sold them, aud brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostle's feet, and distribution was wade unto every man according ns he had need."" What ever may have been the cause of this, we have fie hi'storienl fact of ths attempt to found the Christian Church c n the basis of a community of common possession . How loner this state of things continued we are not able to say ; per hips not long. Auaniiis and his wife early proved it to be unworkable at that stage of mm's history. We have a relic of the same state of things in THE MONASTIC OBDEBS. These have brought the system down to the present, practisiug it all through the ages. The monks teach ns the possibility of man sacrificing all things for the good of the order to which he belongs, and the possibility of men living together in common. Oar great dif ference between what has been and what 1 socialists would have to be must not be over- j looked. In the patriarchal and Mosaic age there was the family and tribal relation to bind together.; and theEsscnes, early Christians, and the monks were bound together by the strong bond of common religious interest ; the socialists have no bond but that of pecuniary interest for self. Also, all previous societies hnve bf-en voluntary associations, and that which they would establish, to be effectual and to include all, must be cojppulsoiv. We can find socialism in almost every age, and yet aocinlism has never been in existence practically among men. We cannot reason from the past to the furure in this case, because of the diverse conditions. Socialism of the past has been fraternal, voluntary, and deeply religious ; that of tho present discards religion, is menniuglc?s if voluntary and the only fraternal bond is the brotherhood of humanity, which at present is an unworkable idea. The two things have in common only a single result, community ot goods, they obtained it by self denial ; can we attain to it by self-interest ? KAEL MABX may be considered the author of socialism in its modern form. He is reckoned to be the most influential socialist writer in Germany, and his book, "" Das Capital "" is the great store house whence all tho rest derive their principal tioughts. He was preceded by others in Germany as well as in France. Wars acknow ledged that the French were before the Germans when he wrote ""The emancipation oc Germany will be that of all humanity, but when all is ready in Germany, the insurrection will only wake at the crowing of the gallic cock."" We shall not speak of the philosophers who procceeded him, but proceed at once to deal with Marx and his teachings. Karl Marx was born at Trenes, on the 2nd May, ISIS. His father was a baptised Jew. H*e studied law with great success at tho University of ""Bonier. He refused the advantageous posts held out to !»'»». ■• *■:■• -v;-v'-«j of the st;ite, and gave himself euflrH* :<> the study of Political Economy and j>.i;.;!iy the soci.tl rpiostion. Xc Whs prosccui. d: v ;he Prusdiun O--»-erti«»""'»it f/* r his nxtreme •']>ir--i<:;j<» > and he took refuge in Paris. He wa.~ i\j>?ircrt 110 m France in""l 841 and from Brussels i:> 1818. He returned to Gcrasny. and bcin^; prosecuted anew he fled for refpge to London. He remained in London dividing his ti.T.o between economical studies and the secret direction of the international. In 1847 ha drew up, with the aid of his friend Fredrich Engels. in the name of tho German Communists in London, a mani festo formulating the two principles of European socialism. First, tho interests of the trorking classes in their struggle against the capitalists being everywhere tho same, rise above the distinction of nationality ; and second, working men should acquire political rights in order to break the yoke of the capitalists. Marx, like Henry George, bases his system upon the principles formulated by such writers as Adam Smith. They both commence with the idea of labour being the sole source of wealth and capital, taken from A. Smith, and both by infallible logic lead us to different conclusions, leaving an impression on the mind that they are not both right, and perhaps are both very far wreng in spite of their lojnc. Marx maintains that the work man's ""labour force"" is ""the sole source of value."" He maintains that the capitalist increases his capital by paying the workman less than the value of his labour and keejmig the surplus labour value as profit for himself! He explains it by saying that the labourer is required to work by his employer for twelve hours or more per day. In six hours he can produce enough to support himself, and during the remaining six Lours he produces the ""surplus value "" to the profit of hi 3 employees. The employer thus for every workman,"" and for every day they work, appropriates the result of six hours labour out of the twelve, without giving an equivalent for it to the workmen. This surplus which is claimed by the employer produces capital. He says ''The mystery of productive labour resolves itself into this fact, that a certain quantity of labour is euiployed without being paid for."" Also, ""By itself capital is inert, it is dead libour which can revive only by sucking, vuncire-like. the blood id living labour, and which lives and thrives with all the more vigour tae more blood it absorbs."" * ° We cannot deny the truth of Marx's con clusions that the workman's labour is worth more than he receives for it ; and there is no doubt that capital is augmented by the surplus Tilue of labour. One important fact is over looked, viz., that interest is necessary to the existence of capital as much as wages is to labour. Gratuitous credit may exist among friends, but in political econony it is unknown ; aad business cannot bo carried on unless some raturn be made to capital. The only solution of the difficulty appears to be the combining in one person, or one class of persons, em ployer and workman as in the trade guides of the middle ages, peosan: proprietors, or the modern co-operative system. Marx hardly gives a true statement ot"" the case, as he over looks two factors, rent and interest. The great fallacy of his system is the measuring of all things by the amount of labour required to produce them on the average. If these were true, then first class wheat would be of no more value than second class in many cases, because on poor soil the second class costs as much in labour as the first on good soil. The great work of Marx was in connection with the inter national, of which we shall speak presently ; but now let us tjke a brief glance at another principal leader FERDINAND T.Afi«UT.T.ii; He is not the author of socialism in the same sense as Marx. He rather took hold of the teachings of Marx and others, and popularised them; aud by his eloquence and personal influenco seemed to impart to them a new life. It & said that in two years his burning words and fiery peu had stirred all Germany, and created the democratic socialist party. He j was the first to bring socialism from the regions of philanthropy and philosophy and to dessiminate it in the streets and workshops. He was born at Brc?lun on the 11th of April, 1825. Like Marx he was of Jewish parentage. He was associated in his work with the Countess Sophie von Hatzfeld, who took a gqeat interest in the political and social questions of the day. He mixed with the political men and shared the displeasure of some of the ruling powers as well as Marx. He was once tried for having instigated civil was but acquited, and then prosecuted in the police court for resistance to the police, and condemned to six months imprisonment.

83,1889-09-28,NA,Northern Advocate,28,IS THE BIBLE DIVINE ?,"(To the Editor.) Sic, — Feeling suro that you will allow this burning question to be ventilated in your valu able paper— a question that, at the present time occupies the attention of many thinking men, and a question that I am sure will be more or less interesting to many of your readers. First, then, "" Does the Bible come from God ? Is it altogether from God? or is it mixed with purely human maxims, statements that may not be exactly true ? Is it a mixture of ignorance, error, and superstition ? "" As a careful student of the Bible, I have no hesitation in saying that those who affirm the presence of a human and infallible element, teach a Bible that no one knows the real nature of, and opens a question of far reaching importance. If man has loft hfa stain and impress upon it, who can tell the number of stains or depth of im pressions ? If only part is from God, who is to fix the limits of the inspired and the reliable ? Every man will have to determine for himself ; and, with the bias of human judgment, funda mentally opposed to dirine thoughts, the fallible portion of Scripture will enlarge in the inverse ratio of a man's divine illumination. Every one will feel at liberty to curtail the inspired Scriptures in different portions, and the part 9 retained as inspired will be robbed of their power. The process of inspiration has not been precisely 'defined to us. We have no authority to explain it. The Scriptures do not pre ont either its manner or its measure as an object to study. What it offers to our faith is solely the inspiration of what they say — the divinity of the book they have written. What the writers of the book say is from God. Whether they recite the mysteries of a past more remote creation, or those of the dim and distant future, the eternal counsels of the Most High, or the secrets of man's heart, or the deep things of God ; whether they describe their own emotion, or relate what they remember, or repeat contemporary narratives, or copy old gonealogies, or make extracts from uninspired documents, their writing is inspired, their narratives are directed from above ; it is always God who speaks, who relates, who ordains, or reveals by their mouth, and who, in order to do this employs their personality in different measures, aud although it is always the word of man, since they are always men who speak or write, it is always God too, seeing that it is God who guides and superintends their work. They give their narratives, their doctrines, or their commandments, ""not with the words of man's wisdom, but with the words taug; t by the Holy Spirit."" God has constituted Himself the author of their work. Within the last few years three descriptions of man, without dis avowing the divinity of Christianity, and with out daring to deny the authority of the Scriptures, yet constituting themselves judges in these matters, have rejected the doctrines of the inspiration of the Scriptures where it has pleased them to do so. Some of these have disowned the very existence of the action of the Holy Spirit ; others have denied its universality ; others again its plenitude. The first reject all miraculous inspiration, and put the sacred writers upon the same level as Cicero did the poets, ajHntum. xpb'itus divbi't. The second, while admitting the existence of a divine in spiration, would confine it to a part of the sacred books only. For example, to a part of the epistles, to a part of Moses, a part of Isaiah, and a part of Daniel. These portions of the Scripture, say they are from God, the others from man. The third class extend, it is true, the idea of a divine inspiriation to all parts of the Bible, but not to all equally. Inspiration, as thoy understand it, might be universal in deed, but unequal ; often imperfect, accom panied with innocent errors j and carried to very different degrees, according to the nature of different passages. Many of these, par ticularly in England, have gone so far as to distinguish the degrees of divine inspirations. Here they are, the inspirations of superirter dents, the inspirations of elevations, the in spiration of direction, and the inspiration of suggestion. To my mind these are the pro duct of a corrupt theology. The Bible says not a word of such distinction. During the first eight centuries of the Ci^utiau era nothing of them 1 _ they. jjrti ■HJ|^Hß^g7fi^pp^PT«BfiuiouB in wj\ PRHt^^^rffof the first unproftauce thaJPSr? should know whether there has been a divine and miraculous inspiration of the Scripture. Next, we ought to know if every part of the Bible is equally inspired, and wo ought to satisfy ourselves as to whether there is a human, and consequently an erring and unreliable, element intermixed with that which is generally admitted to be divine. We ought to know if the historical books as well as the prophesies ; the Gospels as well as the Song of Solomon ; and we ought to be sui'e about Mark and Luke, as well as John and Matthew ; the history of Paul's shipwreck in the waters of the Adriatic, as well as the shipwreck of tho old world ; the scents of Mamre beneath the tents of Abraham &c. What can we say to the quotation from the Psalms a thousand years before the advent of Christ. ""My God, ray God, why hast thou forsaken me ? They have pierced my hands and my feet; they have cast bts upon my vesture, &c."" I believe that it can be established beyond doubt that the Scrpitures are divine and infallible. If this cannot be done, then where is the foundation of our Christian doctrinesj? I have written in the hope that someone better versed in this important subject will take tho matter up, and ventilate the question in your colnmns.— Yours, &c.

He charged the Judge with having compelled him to stop practice in Courts at Wellington, also with having unjustifilably attacked his honor and truth, and accused him of writing anonymous letter to which he had signed his name, they had continu ally interrupted him in Court with disparaging remarks corruptly favoring his opponents, delaying justice to his clients, and forcing- them to bank ruptcy.

84,1889-09-28,NA,Northern Advocate,29,(To the Editor).,"Sic, — I notice in your issue of the 14 th a letter of Mr Carter's in reply to mine of the 7th inst. with regard to the size of tires, which is a very one sided affair of his. He makes it appear that it was for myself I was speaking, and not for the settlers at the back. Now it is for them that I wrote, as I can get to my place with a buggy at any time, which a back settler cannot even with a draj\ Now if those laws are passed, the settlers' will have to pay nearly double what they pay now, if half a ton is to be a load. Surely Mr Carter does not think 15/ a day too much to dtag a load ten or twelve miles over such roads as we have now for a man and team of horses. Whereas if the by-law is passed we shall only have half a ton to cart for the same money ; whereas a settler now gets as much taken ""as a team is able to draw. With regard to the com fed horses, every carter has to corn feed them or they would not do two days' work and corn feeding moans money which tir Carter seems to know nothing about. Thore are some men who try to make a living by carting and contracting, the same as Mr Carter does with his farm and beef. My motto is ""Live and live."" Now Mr Editor, if Mr Carter had a team of horses carting the coal and had those horses to feed, he would not be crying out for wider tiers or lighter loads, as I will just explain what they get for a team of three liorsos and a man to cart a ton of coal from Hikurangi. They pay eight shillings for it at the mines and get eighteen for it in Whangarei ; so you see there is a lot to feed horses with ; and yet he wants the carters and settlers to put their hands in their pockets and pay £10 or £12 for a new set of wheels. I say it won't pay anyone to coal that distance in the winter time. Wkat would the roads be like if the same amount of timber was carted now as was four or five years ago ? But if five hundred feet is to be a load for a waggon there is evidently to be no timber carting. Mr Carter has given us no remody how we are to proceed, only by lighting the loads ; not even asked where the metal road is to be defined from. If there was no wheel traffic the roads would be bad where there is no metal ; if it had only pack horses on it with such a winter as we have had. As I suggested before, what we do in regard to[| metalling and gravelling 1 let it be done well and up to the mark. Would Mr Carter kindly inform the public how much coal has been used on the other side of Kamo As regards the gum and timber carting, what has kept Whangarei going but the gum and timber ? Why it is the gum that has kept the settlers here and found a market for our beef and jn-oduce. And now they want to restrict our storekeepers and carters with the width of tiers, and the loads they shall carry. Henry Cjikeseman. (To the Editor""). Sir,— l trust you will grant me a little space in your papai* to reply briefly to the criticisms of Couutry Settler, in reference to my remarks in a former issue ou the above subject. In the first place, Country Settler assumes that I am in favour of the by-law proposed by the Council. If he refers to my letter he will find that his imm agination is responsible for tha* statement. Country Settler is very fortunate to get his goods delivered for the price stated. If the traffic is regulated the roads will be better next winter, so that he may look for even cheaper cartage. In reference to Country Settler's remarks on rates in the Hikurangi district, I venture to say that there is no dis trict around here which has done more work, or levied higher rates in proportion to population than Hikurangi has. During one year a rate of sixpence per acre was collected, and seventy pounds spent on the main road. Not long ago the Messrs Carters and McKenzie erected a bridge valued at £35, the Boad Board only giving assistance to the extent of £12. Country Settler says if I was interested in the carting of coal, &c, I would change my tune. It is a frequent saying that "" none are so blind as those who wiil not see."" In my fomer letter I plainly stated that I was interested in the cartin"" of coal, so that if there is any tune to be changed it is Country Settler who must change it. I think it probable that if Country Settler was to sign his name it would bo seeii that he is to some extent interested in store keeping and sawmilling. — Yours, &c. A. Cabteb.

A deputation of Ruatangata and Purua settlers waited on the Council in respect to a deviation of the road from the Ruatangata West School house leading to the Purua Bridge. On behalf of the deputation, Mr Street pointed out the wretched state of the present road, the perilous condition of the bridge by Mr Clow's, as well as the fact that the road, even if thousands of pounds were spent on it, could never be made a practicable road, and would ultimately have to be abandoned. The proposed deviation was through the properties of himself (Mr Street) and Mr Powlesland, which was, on the other hand a perfectly level road, and avoided all bridges. He (Mr Street) believed it would cost the Council, in the immediate future, more to repair the defective bridge and make the approaches, than to make the propose deviation. Mr Street said that although he was not immediately interested in the proposed deviation, as the road was beyond his property, yet, for the benefit of the district, he would allow the deviation on the same condition as that stated by Mr Powlesland, viz: — that a certain useless cross road through his property, which affected no other properties, was closed. This exchange being effected, the deviation could be made, and he •wouM not only sacrifice the fencing and shelter trees along the line, but also erect the road fence as well. Other members of the deputation also strongly urged the change. The County Engineer stated that the present line of road must ultimately be abandoned, as it was utterly impractic able, and also stated that the proposed road was absolutely level, and avoided bridges. It was quite true that it would cost more to repair the present bridge and approaches, than to pay the legal costs of the deviation. The change would be a great public good. Cr. Wakelin also advised the change, and thought that the present was the best time to effect it,|as better terms could not be secured. Cr. Mallabond moved, ""That the request of the deputation be granted."" Seconded by Cr. Carter, and carried. Mr Smith waited on the Council, re > questing that a certain deviation should be made at Whareora. After the Council had heard the proposition of Mr Smith, the Engineer was instructed to inspect B^ the locality and report to a future meet- B The following report was read : — Ejtohceeb's Ekpobt fob Seftescbeb, 1889. B the honour to report herewith H^HSondition of the roads throughout the Within the hist month I have travel- the greater portion of these roads, found out by enquiry the condition The result of my travels I^^^^Huiries is a settled canviction that, with traffic, and the present means at of the Council, some of these roads in passible order during a Further, that if it only rains there are 40 or 50 miles of road which coinot be kept even safe to travel on in the dark. they be kept safe if the Council times as much money at their dis- what they are likely to have for to come. These remarks do not the Great North Road, because the HJ^Ldlin"" of the portions through the worst is already far advanced A few years see the gaps filled in any case, because the roads Are cut up by traffic, there the population to collect rates from. B^ The roads I allude to are like the road from to Poroti, Kamo to Purua, to Waikiekie, and so on. These through long stretches of country where little rates are collected, and where very is ever likely to be collected. The gum traffic goes on without intermission K^all through the winter, and in fact it would ■ seem to be more active during that period than f during summer. This appears to be unavoid able at present, and of course any industry so important should be encouraged, rather than interferred with by vexatious restrictions. Still the conviction is forced upon me, that most of the trouble is caused by narrow wheels and heavy loads, carted in the beginning of winter. If the carters would only load their drays as light in the early part of the winter as what they are forced to do later on, not half the damage would be done. If the wheels, also where broad enough, the damage done to the roads would be reduced to a point, which would enable the Council to keep all the roads in decent repair. This, under present circum stances, they are utterly unable to do 30. I am sorry to observe amongst some of the carters' a disposition to regard the County Council as their natural enemy who are trying to oppress them. And, some will also argue that a broad wheel will be harder to pull, and cut up the roads as much as a narrow one. This argument is equivalent to a contention that the back of a knife will cut as well as the edge. Now it must be admitted that it is a hardship for carters' to change their wheels, but I am fully convinced by the testimony of men who used broad wheels that they are the best for clay roads, and if they once come into use, no one will benefit so much as the carters' themselves. There arc many miles of road in the out districts, with a skin of pipeclay on top, and yellow clay underneath. Let that pipeclay be once cut through by a heavy load on a narrow wheel, and it instantly goes down several inches. Each successive wheel cuts deeper, until the rut is axle deep, and when the surface of a road is well broken, the wheels act like ploughs in slicing up the road until it becomes a perfect slough. A of cases have come under my observation, where one single heavy load carted in the beginning of winter, has done an amount of damage equal to many times the value of the load carried. Several of these loads could just as well have been carted during the preceding summer, and this want of forethought has caused many complaints. The lengthy nature of these remarks will be excused by the fact that the by-law relating to traffic will be considered to-night, and also, that the subject is one of the greatest impor tance ever brought before the Council. I have been harrassed all through the winter by a dread of accidents happening on these roads, and some of them are unsafe in the dark now. Unless some sweeping change is made the evil may recur in future winters. The settlers should then be warned to do their carting while the roads were good, to stay at home as much as possible during winter, and above all to avoid travelling in the dark. I will now briefly suggest a change m the system of metalling which has obtained hitherto in this and adjoining Counties, al though perhaps it has been abandoned half a century ago in older countries. No doubt, the same reasons which caused them to aban don the se&tem long ago, should cause ua to abandon it now. As you are aware the specifications have hitherto demanded that the metal should be laid of a certain width and depth, and broken to certain size. This breaking has nearly al ways been done on the road, and a trial of our six years has convinced me that the system is radically wrong. The late hard times, and consequent low tenders have brought this matter to a point which shew* that it would be unwise to continue it further. In fact the system has a strong tendency to turn the con tractor who gets the tender low into a rogue. le The inspector is turned into a detective, a ro for which very few men are fitted, and all th rival contractors are turned into informers. The result of this state of affairs is that the inspecter is harrassed beyond endurance, |the work is hardly ever done as it should be, and the whole arrangement has a most demoralis ing effect on all ""parties. The chaupe which I would now suggest is that the metal should be delivered, averaging so many yards to the chain, and spread by a man in the employment of the County Council. In laying slate rock and gravel, this system would havo the distinct advantage of shewing the spreader the quality of the metal as well as the quantity, and any loads he might object to should not count. It is one of the greatest importance that every load shoild be in spected, because even one bad load may cause a dangerous bog. Asain the spreader could vary tho depth to 6uit soft places, which is another very important point, and ones that has not been enough considered in the past. In conclusion I am sorry to report that a considerable amouut of damage was done to bridges and culverts by the last floods, num bers of which were sub-merged and the em bankments torn by the rush of water. A number of old bridges have also collapsed, owing to their being undermined, and the ex tra expense entailed on the County by the severity of the winter would amount to several hundred pounds. Cr. McKay moved the adoption of the report. ADJOURNED SPECIAL MEETING, A deputation in respect to the pro posed by-law regulating road traffic, was received by the Council. Mr Rawnsley said, that the proposed by-law was against the best interest of the County. If carried, it would mean closing his business five months in the tar. He believed there were not five ople in his riding in favour of the pro position. He said a load could not be pulled through the mud with wide tires. Mr Rawnsley suggested that, as it was so late in the season, the matter should rest awhile. The gumdigging was a very important matter, and if men were driven from the fields they would come on the Charitable Aid funds. Mr Cheeseman said, if the bye-law was passed, every settler would have to get wide tires, which would cost him £10, and then not be able to cany more than half a load. Cr. Wakelix said that it would be a hardship for settlers to get new wheels. He thought the case would be met by not allowing more than a ton of gum to be carried at one load. Some limit must be fixed, but it must be done without in jury to anyone if possible. What Mr Eawusley said was quite true ; the tax would come directly on the gumdigger. The cry of summer traffic was nonsense. It was impossible to limit traffic to summer. Gum was too costly and too variable an article to store until summer ; and the settler could not limit his business to summer. Mr Jackson spoke against the by-law, and favoured the postponmeut of the measure. He had heard no argument in favour of the by-law. Cr. McKay favonred the postponment. Cr. Carter favoured postponing the operation of tho by law for the present season, as the winter was nearly over, but thought the matter should be decided now. He thought the present proposition stringent, but something had to be done. Summer traffic was nonsense. 100 tons of gum could not be stored, and the gum digger must be fed. While the traffic must be regulated, care must be taken not 'to cripple the /jam and timber in dustries. The Chairman said, that it appeared to him the subject had been pretty well thrashed out. It had been said by one speaker that uo argument had been ad vanced in favour of the by-law. He (the Chairman) said that he certainly iad not heard a single argument against it. All the arguments he had heard wer« "" I shall suffer."" He was sorry to see so much selfishness exhibited. He did not ""Want to cripple any industry. But he must act for the public good and for the protection of public property. At pre sent people did not care what they carry. No sense or judgment was exercised. If less loads were carried early in the winter, the roads would not be cut up. But heavy loads were carried, and more horses were put on, until it could be done no louger. and carters had, at last, to come down to less weight than that proposed by even the prosed obnoxious by-law. It had been said that the present winter had been ex ceptionally wet, and that the roads had been exceptionally bad. That was so, and was only a reason why they should bave had exceptional treatment. The Council wished to foster every industry, and it was for this reason that they wish to protect their roads from abuse. He believed the passing of this by-law would benefit rather than injure the gum industry, for it allowed a ton on four pair of wheels, and he believed that Mr Rawnsley was not,|at the present time, carrying that much from Poroti ; he believed he could not do it and do his horses justice. He was willing to listen to any reasonable objections, but he was resolved on protecting the roads from abuse. Cr, Wilson said he would move the adoption of the by-law as a matter of form ; but they all agreed that something must oe done. The gum question was not the question of the day, there was the coal As far as the Maunu road was con cerned, a man had recently brought over it a load of wood which did the road more harm than a hundred loads should have done, and that man was M r Jack son. Revenue will become less instead of increasing, and the roads must be pro tected. Cr. Mallabond said, that whatever is done should be done now, that prepar ation could be made for another winter. The by-law may require modification, but the principle must be carried out. The settler was not prejudiced by the proposition, as he could carry half-a-ton with his present wheels, and he could not carry more. No change of tires was needed in his case He would second the adoption of tho by-law. The resolution adopting the by-law was put and carried. The law is to the following effect: — In pursuance of the powers rested in them, under- «' The Counties Act, 1886,"" the Council of the Whangarei County ordain as follows :— That is to say, that between the first days of May and November in each year, the weight carried by different vehicles shall be as follows, Tiz: — L — YeMcks witi* tires over 4£ inches and under 5* inches wide, to carry not over 15 cwfc os unmetaHed roads, and not over 25 cwt. on. metalled roads, on each pair of wheels. 2. — Vehicles with- tiers over 3| inches and under 4i inches wide, to carry not over 12 cwt. on unmetalled roads, and not over one ton on metalled roads, for each pair of wheels. 3. — Vehicles with tiers over 2 J inches and under 3| inches wide, to carry not more than 10 cwt. on unmetalled roads, and not more than 15 cwt. on metalled roads, for each of wheels. 4.— Vehicles with tiers over 2 inches and under 2\ inches wide, to carry not more than 8 cwt on unmetalled roads, and not more than 12 cwt. on metalled roads, for each pair of wheels. s.— Vehicles with tires under 2 inches wide, to carry not more than 5 cwt. on uumetalled road's, and not more 8 cwt. on metalled roads, for each pair of wheels. 6.— That ho horses or vehicles, be driven, led, or taken over any bridge of more than ten feet span, at other than a walking pace. 7.— The Council have decided that the weight of timber shall be as follows, viz.'.:— That a measured ton of firewood weighs 14 cwt. That 500 superficial feet of kauri weighs 15 cwt. That 500 superficial feet of puriri or green totara weighs a ton. B.— For any offence under the above by-law, the penalty to be not more than five pounds for each offence, to be recoverable in a summary manner before two or more Justices of the Peace, under "" The Justie3 of the Peace Act, 1882."" PETITION. A petition from the ratepayers of the Manaia Highway District, praying that that district be merged into the County was read. Cr. Mallabond said that he had no objection to this particular petition, but he objected to the principle. The County was undertaking a serious responsibility in these mergings. If his board were merged, an additional 45 miles of road would be thrown on the Council. The difficulty was that, as long as any board existed in any riding, no special rate could be struck in such riding, so that the County had to undertake the ad ditional responsibility without additional revenue. Cr. Wakelin was opposed to the principle of merging. Cr Wilson favoured the petition, and thought that it would be better if all highway boaids were done away with. Cr McKay thought, as the law stood, the Council had no option. If a board petitioned to merge, they must acquiesce. This was not a similar case to that of Maunu. In that district there was a eerious divison, and two pretty equally balanced petitions were before the Council. In the case of Manaia there was no difference of opinion. He would move, "" That the petition of the Manaia Highway District for merging into the County be adopted, in accordance with the provisions of the Act."" Carried. ADJOURNED GENERAL MEETING. M Morgon waited on the Council, and asked for assistance in replacing a bridge at Otaika, which had been washed away by the floods. It was agreed to vote £2 10/ towards the work. Mr Rawnsley waited on the Council respecting a road through Taurau's property, at Whatitiri, to Poroti. He said that that must ultimately be the main road from Whangarei to that district, and that Taurau was willing to sell. That many settlers would willingly contribute towards the purchase of the line of road. The Council agreed with Mr Rawnsley that the line proposed must ultimately be that adopted, and were willing to do their utmost to forward his views. If Mr Rawnsley would confer with the settlers interested, and state to the Council what they were prepared to do, the Chairman said he had no doubt the Council would meet them in the matter, and render all the help possible. ACCOUNTS. Accounts to the amount of £298 16/10 were read and passed for payment. Cr. Mallabond moved, "" That the Parua Wharf Road be handed over to the Parua Highway Board, together with all papers in connection therewith, and that a copy of this resolution, be forwarded to the Chairman of the Parua Highway Board."" Carried. Cr. Mallabond moved, ""That A. McKenzie's offer to keep in repair No. 3 section, Manaia road, for the specified term, for the sum of £16, be accepted."" Carried. THE NEW RATE. Cr. Wakelin moved, "" That a rate of three-farthings in the £ be struck on the rateable property in the county, payable i on the 11th of November."" .
